	<h2>IN EXPLANATION</h2>
	
		<p>
		  Many of the verses in this book are republished, with considerable
		  alterations, from various newspapers. The collection includes few not
		  relating to persons and events more or less familiar to the people of the
		  Pacific Coast&mdash;to whom the volume may be considered as especially
		  addressed, though, not without a hope that some part of the contents may
		  be found to have sufficient intrinsic interest to commend it to others. In
		  that case, doubtless, commentators will be "raised up" to make exposition
		  of its full meaning, with possibly an added meaning read into it by
		  themselves.
		</p>
		<p>
		  Of my motives in writing, and in now republishing, I do not care to make
		  either defense or explanation, except with reference to those persons who
		  since my first censure of them have passed away. To one having only a
		  reader's interest in the matter it may easily seem that the verses
		  relating to those might more properly have been omitted from this
		  collection. But if these pieces, or, indeed, if any considerable part of
		  my work in literature, have the intrinsic worth which by this attempt to
		  preserve some of it I have assumed, their permanent suppression is
		  impossible, and it is only a question of when and by whom they shall be
		  republished. Some one will surely search them out and put them in
		  circulation.
		</p>
		<p>
		  I conceive it the right of an author to have his fugitive work collected
		  in his lifetime; and this seems to me especially true of one whose work,
		  necessarily engendering animosities, is peculiarly exposed to challenge as
		  unjust. That is a charge that can be best examined before time has effaced
		  the evidence. For the death of a man of whom I may have written what I
		  venture to think worthy to live I am no way responsible; and, however
		  sincerely I may regret it, I can hardly be expected to consent that it
		  shall affect my fortunes. If the satirist who does not accept the
		  remarkable doctrine that while condemning the sin he should spare the
		  sinner were bound to let the life of his work be coterminous with that of
		  his subject his were a lot of peculiar hardship.
		</p>
		<p>
		  Persuaded of the validity of all this, I have not hesitated to reprint
		  even certain "epitaphs" which, once of the living, are now of the dead, as
		  all the others must eventually be. The objection inheres in all forms of
		  applied satire&mdash;my understanding of whose laws and liberties is at
		  least derived from reverent study of the masters. That in respect of
		  matters herein mentioned I have but followed their practice can be shown
		  by abundant instance and example.
