							<span>I know not if it was a dream. I viewed</span>
							<br/>
							<span>A city where the restless multitude,</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">Between the eastern and the western deep</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Had roared gigantic fabrics, strong and rude.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>Colossal palaces crowned every height;</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Towers from valleys climbed into the light;</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">O'er dwellings at their feet, great golden domes</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Hung in the blue, barbarically bright.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>But now, new-glimmering to-east, the day</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Touched the black masses with a grace of gray,</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">Dim spires of temples to the nation's God</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Studding high spaces of the wide survey.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>Well did the roofs their solemn secret keep</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Of life and death stayed by the truce of sleep,</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">Yet whispered of an hour when sleepers wake,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>The fool to hope afresh, the wise to weep.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>The gardens greened upon the builded hills</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Above the tethered thunders of the mills</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">With sleeping wheels unstirred to service yet</span>
							<br/>
							<span>By the tamed torrents and the quickened rills.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>A hewn acclivity, reprieved a space,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Looked on the builder's blocks about his base</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">And bared his wounded breast in sign to say:</span>
							<br/>
							<span>"Strike! 't is my destiny to lodge your race.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>"'T was but a breath ago the mammoth browsed</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Upon my slopes, and in my caves I housed</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">Your shaggy fathers in their nakedness,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>While on their foeman's offal they caroused."</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>Ships from afar afforested the bay.</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Within their huge and chambered bodies lay</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">The wealth of continents; and merrily sailed</span>
							<br/>
							<span>The hardy argosies to far Cathay.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>Beside the city of the living spread—</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Strange fellowship!—the city of the dead;</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">And much I wondered what its humble folk,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>To see how bravely they were housed, had said.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>Noting how firm their habitations stood,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Broad-based and free of perishable wood—</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">How deep in granite and how high in brass</span>
							<br/>
							<span>The names were wrought of eminent and good,</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>I said: "When gold or power is their aim,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>The smile of beauty or the wage of shame,</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">Men dwell in cities; to this place they fare</span>
							<br/>
							<span>When they would conquer an abiding fame."</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>From the red East the sun—a solemn rite—</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Crowned with a flame the cross upon a height</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">Above the dead; and then with all his strength</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Struck the great city all aroar with light!</span>

							<span>I know not if it was a dream. I came</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Unto a land where something seemed the same</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">That I had known as 't were but yesterday,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>But what it was I could not rightly name.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>It was a strange and melancholy land.</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Silent and desolate. On either hand</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">Lay waters of a sea that seemed as dead,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>And dead above it seemed the hills to stand,</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>Grayed all with age, those lonely hills—ah me,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>How worn and weary they appeared to be!</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">Between their feet long dusty fissures clove</span>
							<br/>
							<span>The plain in aimless windings to the sea.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>One hill there was which, parted from the rest,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Stood where the eastern water curved a-west.</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">Silent and passionless it stood. I thought</span>
							<br/>
							<span>I saw a scar upon its giant breast.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>The sun with sullen and portentous gleam</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Hung like a menace on the sea's extreme;</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">Nor the dead waters, nor the far, bleak bars</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Of cloud were conscious of his failing beam.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>It was a dismal and a dreadful sight,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>That desert in its cold, uncanny light;</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">No soul but I alone to mark the fear</span>
							<br/>
							<span>And imminence of everlasting night!</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>All presages and prophecies of doom</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Glimmered and babbled in the ghastly gloom,</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">And in the midst of that accursèd scene</span>
							<br/>
							<span>A wolf sat howling on a broken tomb.</span>

					<h4 epub:type="title">Elixir Vitӕ</h4>
					<p>
						<span>Of life's elixir I had writ, when sleep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(Pray Heaven it spared him who the writing read!)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sealed upon my senses with so deep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A stupefaction that men thought me dead.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The centuries stole by with noiseless tread,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like spectres in the twilight of my dream;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I saw mankind in dim procession sweep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through life, oblivion at each extreme.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Meanwhile my beard, like Barbarossa's growing,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Loaded my lap and o'er my knees was flowing.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The generations came with dance and song,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And each observed me curiously there.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some asked: "Who was he?" Others in the throng</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Replied: "A wicked monk who slept at prayer."</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some said I was a saint, and some a bear—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These all were women. So the young and gay,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Visibly wrinkling as they fared along,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Doddered at last on failing limbs away;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though some, their footing in my beard entangled,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fell into its abysses and were strangled.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>At last a generation came that walked</span>
						<br/>
						<span>More slowly forward to the common tomb,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then altogether stopped. The women talked</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Excitedly; the men, with eyes agloom</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Looked darkly on them with a look of doom;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And one cried out: "We are immortal now—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How need we these?" And a dread figure stalked,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Silent, with gleaming axe and shrouded brow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all men cried: "Decapitate the women,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or soon there'll be no room to stand or swim in!"</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So (in my dream) each lovely head was chopped</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From its fair shoulders, and but men alone</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were left in all the world. Birth being stopped,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Enough of room remained in every zone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Peace ascended Woman's vacant throne.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thus, life's elixir being found (the quacks</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their bread-and-butter in it gladly sopped)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>'Twas made worth having by the headsman's axe.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Seeing which, I gave myself a hearty shaking,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And crumbled all to powder in the waking.</span>

					<h4 epub:type="title">At the Close of the Canvass</h4>
					<p>
						<span>'Twas a Venerable Person, whom I met one Sunday morning,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">All appareled as a prophet of a melancholy sect;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in a jeremaid of objurgatory warning</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">He lifted up his <i>jodel</i> to the following effect:</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>O ye sanguinary statesmen, intermit your verbal tussles</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">O ye editors and orators, consent to hear my lay!</span>

						<span>And a little while the digital and maxillary muscles</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And attend to what a Venerable Person has to say.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Cease your writing, cease your shouting, cease your wild unearthly lying;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Cease to bandy such expressions as are never, never found</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In the letter of a lover; cease "exposing" and "replying"—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Let there be abated fury and a decrement of sound.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>For to-morrow will be Monday and the fifth day of November—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Only day of opportunity before the final rush.</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Carpe diem!</i> go conciliate each person who's a member</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Of the other party—do it while you can without a blush.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>"Lo! the time is close upon you when the madness of the season</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Having howled itself to silence, like a Minnesota 'clone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Will at last be superseded by the still, small voice of reason,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">When the whelpage of your folly you would willingly disown.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>"Ah, 'tis mournful to consider what remorses will be thronging,</span>

						<span class="i1">With a consciousness of having been so ghastly indiscreet,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When by accident untoward two ex-gentlemen belonging</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">To the opposite political denominations meet!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>"Yes, 'tis melancholy, truly, to forecast the fierce, unruly</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Supersurging of their blushes, like the flushes upon high</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When Aurora Borealis lights her circumpolar palace</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And in customary manner sets her banner in the sky.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>"Each will think: 'This falsifier knows that I too am a liar.</span>

						<span>Curse my leader for another! Curse that pelican, my mother!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Would to God that I when little in my victual had been drowned!'"</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Then that Venerable Person went away without returning</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And, the madness of the season having also taken flight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All the people soon were blushing like the skies to crimson burning</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">When Aurora Borealis fires her premises by night.</span>

					<p>
						<span>You may say, if you please, Johnny Bull, that our girls</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Are crazy to marry your dukes and your earls;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But I've heard that the maids of your own little isle</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Greet bachelor lords with a favoring smile.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Nay, titles, 'tis said in defense of our fair,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Are popular here because popular there;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And for them our ladies persistently go</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Because 'tis exceedingly English, you know.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Whatever the motive, you'll have to confess</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The effort's attended with easy success;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And—pardon the freedom—'tis thought, over here,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>'Tis mortification you mask with a sneer.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>It's all very well, sir, your scorn to parade</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of the high nasal twang of the Yankee maid,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But, ah, to my lord when he dares to propose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No sound is so sweet as that "Yes" from the nose.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Our ladies, we grant, walk alone in the street</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(Observe, by-the-by, on what delicate feet!)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>'Tis a habit they got here at home, where they say</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The men from politeness go seldom astray.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Ah, well, if the dukes and the earls and that lot</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Can stand it (God succor them if they cannot!)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Your commoners ought to assent, I am sure,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And what they're not called on to suffer, endure.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>"'Tis nothing but money?—Your nobles are bought?"</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As to that, I submit, it is commonly thought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That England's a country not specially free</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Crœsi and (if you'll allow it) Crœsӕ.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>You've many a widow and many a girl</span>

						<span>With money to purchase a duke or an earl.</span>
						<br/>

						<span>When goods import buyers from over the sea.</span>

						<span class="i1">Whose tearless eyes behold the chain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And look unmoved upon the slain,</span>
						<br/>

					<p>
						<span>Before thy shrine the races press,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Thy perfect favor to implore—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">The proudest tyrant asks no more,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The ironed anarchist no less.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Thine altar-coals that touch the lips</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Of prophets kindle, too, the brand</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">By Discord flung with wanton hand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the houses and the ships.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Upon thy tranquil front the star</span>

						<span class="i1">Burns bleak and passionless and white,</span>

						<span class="i1">Its cold inclemency of light</span>
						<br/>
						<span>More dreadful than the shadows are.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Thy name we do not here invoke</span>

						<span class="i1">Our civic rites to sanctify:</span>

						<span class="i1">Enthroned in thy remoter sky,</span>

						<span>The light that fills the patriot's tomb</span>

					<p>
						<span>I drifted (or I seemed to) in a boat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the surface of a shoreless sea</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whereon no ship nor anything did float,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Save only the frail bark supporting me;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And that—it was so shadowy—seemed to be</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Almost from out the very vapors wrought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of the great ocean underneath its keel;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all that blue profound appeared as naught</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But thicker sky, translucent to reveal,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Miles down, whatever through its spaces glided,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or at the bottom traveled or abided.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Great cities there I saw—of rich and poor,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The palace and the hovel; mountains, vales,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Forest and field, the desert and the moor,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tombs of the good and wise who'd lived in jails,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And seas of denser fluid, white with sails</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pushed at by currents moving here and there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And sensible to sight above the flat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of that opaquer deep. Ah, strange and fair</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The nether world that I was gazing at</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With beating heart from that exalted level,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And—lest I founder—trembling like the devil!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The cities all were populous: men swarmed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In public places—chattered, laughed and wept;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And savages their shining bodies warmed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At fires in primal woods. The wild beast leapt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon its prey and slew it as it slept.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Armies went forth to battle on the plain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So far, far down in that unfathomed deep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The living seemed as silent as the slain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor even the widows could be heard to weep.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One might have thought their shaking was but laughter;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, truly, most were married shortly after.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Above the wreckage of that silent fray</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Strange fishes swam in circles, round and round—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Black, double-finned; and once a little way</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A bubble rose and burst without a sound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And a man tumbled out upon the ground.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lord! 'twas an eerie thing to drift apace</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On that pellucid sea, beneath black skies</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And o'er the heads of an undrowning race;</span>
						<br/>

						<span>Wretched little Picklepip</span>

						<br/>
						<span>So he thought his aim to reach</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By some figurative speech:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Said his Fate had been unkind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had pursued him from behind</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">(How the mischief could it else?)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came upon him unaware,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Caught him by the collar—there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gushed the little lady's glee</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Like a gush of golden bells:</span>

						<span>"Picklepip, why, that is <i>me</i>!"</span>

						<span>Maundered on about the ship</span>

						<span>That he did not chance to own;</span>

						<span>Cut him off with "So do I!"</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But she reddened at the fib;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Servitors had she, <i>ad lib.</i></span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Town of Dae by the sea,</span>

					<p>
						<span>Witless little Picklepip</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Manned again his mental ship</span>

						<span class="i1">Painted to the lady's thought</span>

						<span class="i1">She had watched her water-knight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through the seasons of a year,</span>

						<br/>
						<span>And conquer better than he knew.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now she shook her pretty pate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And stamped her foot—'t was growing late:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>"Mister Picklepip, when I</span>

						<span>And the silly creature cried—</span>

						<span>Feared, perchance, the rising tide.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Town of Dae by the sea,</span>

					<p>
						<span><i>Fiat lux!</i> Love's lumination</span>

						<span>Something indistinctly heard!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And the soul of Picklepip</span>

						<span>But he spake no further word</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of the wealth he did not own;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In that moment had outgrown</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ship and mine and flock and land—</span>

						<span>Even his cask upon the strand.</span>

						<span>Once I "dipt into the future far as human eye could see,"</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And saw—it was not Sandow, nor John Sullivan, but she—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Emancipated Woman, who was weeping as she ran</span>

						<span>Here and there for the discovery of Expurgated Man.</span>

						<br/>
						<span>All the tendinous connections of her indurated heart.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cried Emancipated Woman, as she wearied of the search:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>"In Advancing I have left myself distinctly in the lurch!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Seeking still a worthy partner, from the land of brutes and dudes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I have penetrated rashly into manless solitudes.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now without a mate of any kind where am I?—that's to say,</span>

						<span>Where shall I be to-morrow?—where exert my rightful sway</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And the purifying strength of my emancipated mind?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Can solitude be lifted up, vacuity refined?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Calling, calling from the shadows in the rear of my Advance—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From the Region of Unprogress in the Dark Domain of Chance—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Long I heard the Unevolvable beseeching my return</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To share the degradation he's reluctant to unlearn.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But I've held my way regardless, evoluting year by year,</span>

						<br/>
						<span>A condensed Emancipation and a Purifier proud</span>

						<span>Independent? Yes, in spirit, but (O, woful, woful state!)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Doomed to premature extinction by privation of a mate—</span>

						<span>To extinction or reversion, for Unexpurgated Man</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still awaits me in the backward if I sicken of the van.</span>

						<br/>
						<span>And in accents of affection and of sympathy it said:</span>

						<span>Impeach Delay and you will make an end.</span>

						<span>For doing all the things that it should not.</span>

						<br/>

						<br/>
						<span>The rascals? Nay, Rascality's the thing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Above whose back your knotted scourges sing.</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Your</i> satire, truly, like a razor keen,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>"Wounds with a touch that's neither felt nor seen;"</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For naught that you assail with falchion free</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Has either nerves to feel or eyes to see.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against abstractions evermore you charge</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You hack no helmet and you need no targe.</span>

						<span>That wickedness is wrong and sin a vice,</span>

						<br/>
						<span>When money-changers in the Temple sat,</span>

					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Good friend, if any judge deserve your blame</span>

						<span>Have you no courage, or has he no name?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon his method will you wreak your wrath,</span>

						<span>Himself all unmolested in his path?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fall to! fall to!—your club no longer draw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To beat the air or flail a man of straw.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Scorn to do justice like the Saxon thrall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who cuffed the offender's shadow on a wall.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Let rascals in the flesh attest your zeal—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Knocked on the mazzard or tripped up at heel!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>We know that judges are corrupt. We know</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That crimes are lively and that laws are slow.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We know that lawyers lie and doctors slay;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That priests and preachers are but birds of pray;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That merchants cheat and journalists for gold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Flatter the vicious while at vice they scold.</span>
						<br/>

						<span>Names, here and there, to show whose head is hit,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The bad would sentence and the good acquit.</span>

						<span>Rebukes most personal are least unfair.</span>

						<span>To fire at random if you still prefer,</span>

						<span>Permit me yet one ultimate appeal</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To something that you understand and feel:</span>

					<h4 epub:type="title">The Hesitating Veteran</h4>
					<p>
						<span>When I was young and full of faith</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And other fads that youngsters cherish</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A cry rose as of one that saith</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">With emphasis: "Help or I perish!"</span>
						<br/>
						<span>'Twas heard in all the land, and men</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">The sound were each to each repeating.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It made my heart beat faster then</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Than any heart can now be beating.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>For the world is old and the world is gray—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Grown prudent and, I guess, more witty.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She's cut her wisdom teeth, they say,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And doesn't now go in for Pity.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Besides, the melancholy cry</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Was that of one, 'tis now conceded,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whose plight no one beneath the sky</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Felt half so poignantly as he did.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Moreover, he was black. And yet</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">That sentimental generation</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With an austere compassion set</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Its face and faith to the occasion.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then there were hate and strife to spare,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And various hard knocks a-plenty;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And I ('twas more than my true share,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">I must confess) took five-and-twenty.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>That all is over now—the reign</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Of love and trade stills all dissensions,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And the clear heavens arch again</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Above a land of peace and pensions.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The black chap—at the last we gave</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Him everything that he had cried for,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though many white chaps in the grave</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">'Twould puzzle to say what they died for.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>I hope he's better off—I trust</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">That his society and his master's</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Are worth the price we paid, and must</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Continue paying, in disasters;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But sometimes doubts press thronging round</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">('Tis mostly when my hurts are aching)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If war for union was a sound</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And profitable undertaking.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>'Tis said they mean to take away</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">The Negro's vote for he's unlettered.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>'Tis true he sits in darkness day</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And night, as formerly, when fettered;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But pray observe—howe'er he vote</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">To whatsoever party turning,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He'll be with gentlemen of note</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And wealth and consequence and learning.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With saints and sages on each side,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">How could a fool through lack of knowledge,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Vote wrong? If learning is no guide</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Why ought one to have been in college?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>O Son of Day, O Son of Night!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">What are your preferences made of?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I know not which of you is right,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Nor which to be the more afraid of.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The world is old and the world is bad,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And creaks and grinds upon its axis;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And man's an ape and the gods are mad!—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">There's nothing sure, not even our taxes.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No mortal man can Truth restore,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Or say where she is to be sought for.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I know what uniform I wore—</span>

					<h4 epub:type="title">An Alibi</h4>
					<p>
						<span>A famous journalist, who long</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had told the great unheaded throng</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whate'er they thought, by day or night.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was true as Holy Writ, and right,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was caught in—well, on second thought,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It is enough that he was caught,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And being thrown in jail became</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The fuel of a public flame.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>"<i>Vox populi vox Dei</i>," said</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The jailer. Inxling bent his head</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Without remark: that motto good</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In bold-faced type had always stood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Above the columns where his pen</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had rioted in praise of men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all they said—provided he</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was sure they mostly did agree.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Meanwhile a sharp and bitter strife</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To take, or save, the culprit's life</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or liberty (which, I suppose,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was much the same to him) arose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Outside. The journal that his pen</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Adorned denounced his crime—but then</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Its editor in secret tried</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To have the indictment set aside.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The opposition papers swore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His father was a rogue before,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all his wife's relations were</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like him and similar to her.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They begged their readers to subscribe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A dollar each to make a bribe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That any Judge would feel was large</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Enough to prove the gravest charge—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unless, it might be, the defense</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Put up superior evidence.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The law's traditional delay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was all too short: the trial day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dawned red and menacing. The Judge</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sat on the Bench and wouldn't budge,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all the motions counsel made</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Could not move <i>him</i>—and there he stayed.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>"The case must now proceed," he said,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>"While I am just in heart and head,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It happens—as, indeed, it ought—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Both sides with equal sums have bought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>My favor: I can try the cause</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Impartially." (Prolonged applause.)</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The prisoner was now arraigned</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And said that he was greatly pained</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To be suspected—<em>he</em>, whose pen</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had charged so many other men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With crimes and misdemeanors! "Why,"</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He said, a tear in either eye,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>"If men who live by crying out</span>
						<br/>
						<span>'Stop thief!' are not themselves from doubt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of their integrity exempt,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Let all forego the vain attempt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To make a reputation! Sir,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I'm innocent, and I demur."</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whereat a thousand voices cried</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Amain he manifestly lied—</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Vox populi</i> as loudly roared</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As bull by <i>picadores</i> gored,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In his own coin receiving pay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To make a Spanish holiday.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The jury—twelve good men and true—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were then sworn in to see it through,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And each made solemn oath that he</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As any babe unborn was free</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From prejudice, opinion, thought,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Respectability, brains—aught</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That could disqualify; and some</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Explained that they were deaf and dumb.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A better twelve, his Honor said,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was rare, except among the dead.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The witnesses were called and sworn.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The tales they told made angels mourn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And the Good Book they'd kissed became</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Red with the consciousness of shame.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whenever one of them approached</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The truth, "That witness wasn't coached,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Your Honor!" cried the lawyers both.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>"Strike out his testimony," quoth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The learned judge: "This Court denies</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Its ear to stories which surprise.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I hold that witnesses exempt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From coaching all are in contempt."</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Both Prosecution and Defense</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Applauded the judicial sense,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And the spectators all averred</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such wisdom they had never heard:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>'Twas plain the prisoner would be</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Found guilty in the first degree.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Meanwhile that wight's pale cheek confessed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The nameless terrors in his breast.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He felt remorseful, too, because</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He wasn't half they said he was.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>"If I'd been such a rogue," he mused</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On opportunities unused,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>"I might have easily become</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As wealthy as Methusalum."</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This journalist adorned, alas,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The middle, not the Bible, class.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>With equal skill the lawyers' pleas</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Attested their divided fees.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Each gave the other one the lie,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then helped him frame a sharp reply.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Good Lord! it was a bitter fight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And lasted all the day and night.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When once or oftener the roar</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had silenced the judicial snore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The speaker suffered for the sport</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By fining for contempt of court.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Twelve jurors' noses good and true</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unceasing sang the trial through,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And even <i>vox populi</i> was spent</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In rattles through a nasal vent.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Clerk, bailiff, constables and all</span>

						<span>Heard Morpheus sound the trumpet call</span>

						<span>To arms—his arms—and all fell in</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Save counsel for the Man of Sin.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That thaumaturgist stood and swayed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wand their faculties obeyed—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That magic wand which, like a flame.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Leapt, wavered, quivered and became</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A wonder-worker—known among</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The ignoble vulgar as a Tongue.</span>

						<span>A meter which, the poets say,</span>

						<span>No power of restraint can stay;—</span>

						<span>To him who, having naught to tell,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Must hold attention as a trout</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is held, by paying out and out</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The slender line which else would break</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Should one attempt the fish to take.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thus tavern guides who've naught to show</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But some adjacent curio</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By devious trails their patrons lead</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And make them think 't is far indeed.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where was I?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i4">While the lawyer talked</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The rogue took up his feet and walked:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While all about him, roaring, slept,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Into the street he calmly stepped.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In very truth, the man who thought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The people's voice from heaven had caught</span>
						<br/>
						<span>God's inspiration took a change</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of venue—it was passing strange!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Straight to his editor he went</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And that ingenious person sent</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A Negro to impersonate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The fugitive. In adequate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Disguise he took his vacant place</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And buried in his arms his face.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When all was done the lawyer stopped</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And silence like a bombshell dropped</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the Court: judge, jury, all</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Within that venerable hall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(Except the deaf and dumb, indeed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And one or two whom death had freed)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Awoke and tried to look as though</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Slumber was all they did not know.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And now that tireless lawyer-man</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Took breath, and then again began:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>"Your Honor, if you did attend</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To what I've urged (my learned friend</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nodded concurrence) to support</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The motion I have made, this court</span>
						<br/>
						<span>May soon adjourn. With your assent</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I've shown abundant precedent</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For introducing now, though late,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>New evidence to exculpate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>My client. So, if you'll allow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I'll prove an <i>alibi</i>!" "What?—how?"</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stammered the judge. "Well, yes, I can't</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Deny your showing, and I grant</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The motion. Do I understand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You undertake to prove—good land!—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That when the crime—you mean to show</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Your client wasn't <i>there</i>?" "O, no,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I cannot quite do that, I find:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>My <i>alibi's</i> another kind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of <i>alibi</i>,—I'll make it clear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Your Honor, that he isn't <i>here</i>."</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Darky here upreared his head,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tranquillity affrighted fled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And consternation reigned instead!</span>

					<p>
						<span>Of Hans Pietro Shanahan</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(Who was a most ingenious man)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Muse of History records</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That he'd get drunk as twenty lords.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>He'd get so truly drunk that men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stood by to marvel at him when</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His slow advance along the street</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was but a vain cycloidal feat.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And when 'twas fated that he fall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With a wide geographical sprawl,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They signified assent by sounds</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Heard (faintly) at its utmost bounds.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And yet this Mr. Shanahan</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(Who was a most ingenious man)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cast not on wine his thirsty eyes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When it was red or otherwise.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>All malt, or spirituous, tope</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He loathed as cats dissent from soap;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And cider, if it touched his lip,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Evoked a groan at every sip.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But still, as heretofore explained,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He not infrequently was grained.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(I'm not of those who call it "corned."</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Coarse speech I've always duly scorned.)</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Though truth to say, and that's but right,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Strong drink (it hath an adder's bite!)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was what had put him in the mud,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The only kind he used was blood!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Alas, that an immortal soul</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Addicted to the flowing bowl,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The emptied flagon should again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Replenish from a neighbor's vein.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But, Mr. Shanahan was so</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Constructed, and his taste that low.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor more deplorable was he</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In kind of thirst than in degree;</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>For sometimes fifty souls would pay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The debt of nature in a day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To free him from the shame and pain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of dread Sobriety's misreign.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>His native land, proud of its sense</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of his unique inabstinence,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Abated something of its pride</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At thought of his unfilled inside.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And some the boldness had to say</span>
						<br/>
						<span>'Twere well if he were called away</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To slake his thirst forevermore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In oceans of celestial gore.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But Hans Pietro Shanahan</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(Who was a most ingenious man)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Knew that his thirst was mortal; so</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Remained unsainted here below—</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Unsainted and unsaintly, for</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He neither went to glory nor</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To abdicate his power deigned</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where, under Providence, he reigned,</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But kept his Boss's power accurst</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To serve his wild uncommon thirst.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which now had grown so truly great</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It was a drain upon the State.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Soon, soon there came a time, alas!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When he turned down an empty glass—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All practicable means were vain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His special wassail to obtain.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>In vain poor Decimation tried</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To furnish forth the needful tide;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Civil War as vainly shed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Her niggard offering of red.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Poor Shanahan! his thirst increased</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until he wished himself deceased,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Invoked the firearm and the knife,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But could not die to save his life!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>He was so dry his own veins made</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No answer to the seeking blade;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So parched that when he would have passed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Away he could not breathe his last.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>'Twas then, when almost in despair,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(Unlaced his shoon, unkempt his hair)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He saw as in a dream a way</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To wet afresh his mortal clay.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Yes, Hans Pietro Shanahan</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(Who was a most ingenious man)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Saw freedom, and with joy and pride</span>
						<br/>
						<span>"Thalassa! (or Thalatta!)" cried.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Straight to the Aldermen went he,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With many a "pull" and many a fee,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And many a most corrupt "combine"</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(The Press for twenty cents a line</span>

					<p>
						<span>Held out and fought him—O, God, bless</span>

						<br/>
						<span>Till he had franchises complete</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For trolley lines on every street!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The cars were builded and, they say,</span>

						<span>Rhomboidal roads, and circular,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And oval—everywhere a car—</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Square, dodecagonal (in great</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Esteem the shape called Figure 8)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And many other kinds of shapes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As various as tails of apes.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>No other group of men's abodes</span>

						<span>O nonsense, parson—tell me not they thrive</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And jubilate who follow your dictation.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The good are the unhappiest lot alive—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">I know they are from careful observation.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">If freedom from the terrors of damnation</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lengthens the visage like a telescope,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And lacrymation is a sign of hope,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Then I'll continue, in my dreadful plight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To tread the dusky paths of sin, and grope</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Contentedly without your lantern's light;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And though in many a bog beslubbered quite,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Refuse to flay me with ecclesiastic soap.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>You say 'tis a sad world, seeing I'm condemned,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">With many a million others of my kidney.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Each continent's Hammed, Japheted and Shemmed</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">With sinners—worldlings like Sir Philip Sidney</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And scoffers like Voltaire, who thought it bliss</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To simulate respect for Genesis—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Who bent the mental knee as if in prayer,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">But mocked at Moses underneath his hair,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And like an angry gander bowed his head to hiss.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Seeing such as these, who die without contrition,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Must go to—beg your pardon, sir—perdition,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">The sons of light, you tell me, can't be gay,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But count it sin of the sort called omission</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">The groan to smother or the tear to stay</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Or fail to—what is that they live by?—pray.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So down they flop, and the whole serious race is</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Put by divine compassion on a praying basis.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Well, if you take it so to heart, while yet</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Our own hearts are so light with nature's leaven,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You'll weep indeed when we in Hades sweat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And you look down upon us out of Heaven.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In fancy, lo! I see your wailing shades</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thronging the crystal battlements. Cascades</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of tears spring singing from each golden spout,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Run roaring from the verge with hoarser sound,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Dash downward through the glimmering profound,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Quench the tormenting flame and put the Devil out!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Presumptuous ass! to you no power belongs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To pitchfork me to Heaven upon the prongs</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Of a bad pen, whose disobedient sputter,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With less of ink than incoherence fraught</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Befits the folly that it tries to utter.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Brains, I observe, as well as tongues, can stutter:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You suffer from impediment of thought.</span>
						<span class="i1">Save when considering your bread-and-butter.</span>
						<br/>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>When next you "point the way to Heaven," take care:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Your fingers all being thumbs, point, Heaven knows where!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Farewell, poor dunce! your letter though I blame,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bears witness how my anger I can tame:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I've called you everything except your hateful name!</span>

					<p>
						<span>Christmas, you tell me, comes but once a year.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One place it never comes, and that is here.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Here, in these pages no good wishes spring,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No well-worn greetings tediously ring—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For Christmas greetings are like pots of ore:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The hollower they are they ring the more.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Here shall no holly cast a spiny shade,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor mistletoe my solitude invade,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No trinket-laden vegetable come,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No jorum steam with Sheolate of rum.</span>

						<span>Hurrah for Christmas without Christmas cheer!</span>

						<span>No presents, if you please—I know too well</span>

						<span>What Herbert Spencer, if he didn't tell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(I know not if he did) yet might have told</span>

						<span>When Early Man with gifts propitiated</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The chiefs whom most he doubted, feared and hated,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or tendered them in hope to reap some rude</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Advantage from the taker's gratitude.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Since thus the Gift its origin derives</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(How much of its first character survives</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You know as well as I) my stocking's tied,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>My pocket buttoned—with my soul inside.</span>

						<span>I save my money and I save my pride.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Dinner? Yes; thank you—just a baby's body</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Done to a nutty brown, and a tear toddy</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To give me appetite; and as to drink,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About a half a jug of blood, I think,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Will do; for still I love the good red wine,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Coagulating well, with wrinkles fine</span>

						<br/>
						<span>Enough you have of jester, player, priest:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I as the skeleton attend your feast,</span>

						<span>I mean to hold in customary state,</span>

						<span>Ignore the cheerful season's warmth and bloom</span>

					<p>
						<span>With a Methodist hymn in his musical throat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Sun was emitting his ultimate note;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His quivering larynx enwrinkled the sea</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like an Ichthyosaurian blowing his tea;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When sweetly and pensively rattled and rang</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This plaint which an Hippopopotamus sang:</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“O, Camomile, Calabash, Cartilage-pie,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Spread for my spirit a peppermint fry;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Crown me with doughnuts, and drape me with cheese,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Settle my soul with a codliver sneeze.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lo, how I stand on my head and repine—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lollipop Lumpkin can never be mine!”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Down sank the Sun with a kick and a plunge,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Up from the wave rose the head of a Sponge;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ropes in his ringlets, eggs in his eyes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tip-tilted nose in a way to surprise.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These the conundrums he flung to the breeze,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The answers that Echo returned to him these:</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i1">“Cobblestone, Cobblestone, why do you sigh—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Why do you turn on the tears?”</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">“My mother is crazy on strawberry jam,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">And my father has petrified ears.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i1">“Liverwort, Liverwort, why do you droop—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Why do you snuffle and scowl?”</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">“My brother has cockle-burs into his eyes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">And my sister has married an owl.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i1">“Simia, Simia, why do you laugh—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Why do you cackle and quake?”</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">“My son has a pollywog stuck in his throat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">And my daughter has bitten a snake.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Slow sank the head of the Sponge out of sight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Soaken with sea-water—then it was night.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The Moon had now risen for dinner to dress,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When sweetly the Pachyderm sang from his nest;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He sang through a pestle of silvery shape,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Encrusted with custard—empurpled with crape;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And this was the burden he bore on his lips,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And blew to the listening Sturgeon that sips</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From the fountain of opium under the lobes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of the mountain whose summit in buffalo robes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The winter envelops, as Venus adorns</span>
						<br/>
						<span>An elephant’s trunk with a chaplet of thorns:</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i1">“Chasing mastodons through marshes upon stilts of light ratan,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Hunting spiders with a shotgun and mosquitoes with an axe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Plucking peanuts ready roasted from the branches of the oak,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Waking echoes in the forest with our hymns of blessed bosh,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">We roamed—my love and I.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i1">By the margin of the fountain spouting thick with clabbered milk,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Under spreading boughs of bass-wood all alive with cooing toads,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Loafing listlessly on bowlders of octagonal design,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Standing gracefully inverted with our toes together knit,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">We loved—my love and I.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Hippopopotamus comforts his heart</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Biting half-moons out of strawberry tart.</span>

					<h4 epub:type="title">Communing with Nature</h4>
					<p>
						<span>One evening I sat on a heavenward hill,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The winds were asleep and all nature was still,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wee children came round me to play at my knee,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As my mind floated rudderless over the sea.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I put out one hand to caress them, but held</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With the other my nose, for these cherubim smelled.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I cast a few glances upon the old sun;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He was red in the face from the race he had run,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But he seemed to be doing, for aught I could see,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Quite well without any assistance from me.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And so I directed my wandering eye</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Around to the opposite side of the sky,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And the rapture that ever with ecstasy thrills</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through the heart as the moon rises bright from the hills,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Would in this case have been most exceedingly rare,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Except for the fact that the moon was not there.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But the stars looked right lovingly down in the sea,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, by Jupiter, Venus was winking at me!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The gas in the city was flaring up bright,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Montgomery Street was resplendent with light;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But I did not exactly appear to advance</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A sentiment proper to that circumstance.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So it only remains to explain to the town</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That a rainstorm came up before I could come down.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As the boots I had on were uncommonly thin</span>
						<br/>
						<span>My fancy leaked out as the water leaked in.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though dampened my ardour, though slackened my strain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I’ll “strike the wild lyre” who sings the sweet rain!</span>

					<p>
						<span>Old Zephyr, dawdling in the West,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Looked down upon the sea,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which slept unfretted at his feet,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And balanced on its breast a fleet</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That seemed almost to be</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Suspended in the middle air,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As if a magnet held it there,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Eternally at rest.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then, one by one, the ships released</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their folded sails, and strove</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against the empty calm to press</span>
						<br/>
						<span>North, South, or West, or East,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In vain; the subtle nothingness</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was impotent to move.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ten Zephyr laughed aloud to see:—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“No vessel moves except by me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, heigh—ho! I shall sleep.”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But lo! from out the troubled North</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A tempest strode impatient forth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And trampled white the deep;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sloping ships flew glad away,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Laving their heated sides in spray.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The West then turned him red with wrath,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And to the North he shouted:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Hold there! How dare you cross my path,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As now you are about it?”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The North replied with laboured breath—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His speed no moment slowing:—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“My friend, you’ll never have a path,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unless you take to blowing.”</span>

						<span>Then yawns himself from sheer fatigue.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lifting its finger to the sky,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A marble shaft arrests his eye—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This epitaph, in pompous pride,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Engraven on its polished side:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Perfection of Creation’s plan,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Here resteth Universal Man,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who virtues, segregated wide,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Collated, classed, and codified,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Reduced to practice, taught, explained,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And strict morality maintained.</span>

						<span>Anticipating death, his pelf</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">He lavished on this monolith;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Because he leaves nor kin nor kith</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He rears this tribute to himself,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That Virtue’s fame may never cease.</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Hic jacet</i>—let him rest in peace!”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>With sober eye Jove scanned the shaft,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then turned away and lightly laughed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Poor Man! since I have careless been</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In keeping books to note thy sin,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And thou hast left upon the earth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This faithful record of thy worth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thy final prayer shall now be heard:</span>
