							<span>I know not if it was a dream. I viewed</span>
							<br/>
							<span>A city where the restless multitude,</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">Between the eastern and the western deep</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Had roared gigantic fabrics, strong and rude.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>Colossal palaces crowned every height;</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Towers from valleys climbed into the light;</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">O'er dwellings at their feet, great golden domes</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Hung in the blue, barbarically bright.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>But now, new-glimmering to-east, the day</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Touched the black masses with a grace of gray,</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">Dim spires of temples to the nation's God</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Studding high spaces of the wide survey.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>Well did the roofs their solemn secret keep</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Of life and death stayed by the truce of sleep,</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">Yet whispered of an hour when sleepers wake,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>The fool to hope afresh, the wise to weep.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>The gardens greened upon the builded hills</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Above the tethered thunders of the mills</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">With sleeping wheels unstirred to service yet</span>
							<br/>
							<span>By the tamed torrents and the quickened rills.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>A hewn acclivity, reprieved a space,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Looked on the builder's blocks about his base</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">And bared his wounded breast in sign to say:</span>
							<br/>
							<span>"Strike! 't is my destiny to lodge your race.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>"'T was but a breath ago the mammoth browsed</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Upon my slopes, and in my caves I housed</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">Your shaggy fathers in their nakedness,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>While on their foeman's offal they caroused."</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>Ships from afar afforested the bay.</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Within their huge and chambered bodies lay</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">The wealth of continents; and merrily sailed</span>
							<br/>
							<span>The hardy argosies to far Cathay.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>Beside the city of the living spread—</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Strange fellowship!—the city of the dead;</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">And much I wondered what its humble folk,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>To see how bravely they were housed, had said.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>Noting how firm their habitations stood,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Broad-based and free of perishable wood—</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">How deep in granite and how high in brass</span>
							<br/>
							<span>The names were wrought of eminent and good,</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>I said: "When gold or power is their aim,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>The smile of beauty or the wage of shame,</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">Men dwell in cities; to this place they fare</span>
							<br/>
							<span>When they would conquer an abiding fame."</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>From the red East the sun—a solemn rite—</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Crowned with a flame the cross upon a height</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">Above the dead; and then with all his strength</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Struck the great city all aroar with light!</span>

							<span>I know not if it was a dream. I came</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Unto a land where something seemed the same</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">That I had known as 't were but yesterday,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>But what it was I could not rightly name.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>It was a strange and melancholy land.</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Silent and desolate. On either hand</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">Lay waters of a sea that seemed as dead,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>And dead above it seemed the hills to stand,</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>Grayed all with age, those lonely hills—ah me,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>How worn and weary they appeared to be!</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">Between their feet long dusty fissures clove</span>
							<br/>
							<span>The plain in aimless windings to the sea.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>One hill there was which, parted from the rest,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Stood where the eastern water curved a-west.</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">Silent and passionless it stood. I thought</span>
							<br/>
							<span>I saw a scar upon its giant breast.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>The sun with sullen and portentous gleam</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Hung like a menace on the sea's extreme;</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">Nor the dead waters, nor the far, bleak bars</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Of cloud were conscious of his failing beam.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>It was a dismal and a dreadful sight,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>That desert in its cold, uncanny light;</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">No soul but I alone to mark the fear</span>
							<br/>
							<span>And imminence of everlasting night!</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span>All presages and prophecies of doom</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Glimmered and babbled in the ghastly gloom,</span>
							<br/>
							<span class="i1">And in the midst of that accursèd scene</span>
							<br/>
							<span>A wolf sat howling on a broken tomb.</span>

					<h4 epub:type="title">Elixir Vitӕ</h4>
					<p>
						<span>Of life's elixir I had writ, when sleep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(Pray Heaven it spared him who the writing read!)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sealed upon my senses with so deep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A stupefaction that men thought me dead.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The centuries stole by with noiseless tread,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like spectres in the twilight of my dream;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I saw mankind in dim procession sweep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through life, oblivion at each extreme.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Meanwhile my beard, like Barbarossa's growing,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Loaded my lap and o'er my knees was flowing.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The generations came with dance and song,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And each observed me curiously there.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some asked: "Who was he?" Others in the throng</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Replied: "A wicked monk who slept at prayer."</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some said I was a saint, and some a bear—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These all were women. So the young and gay,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Visibly wrinkling as they fared along,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Doddered at last on failing limbs away;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though some, their footing in my beard entangled,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fell into its abysses and were strangled.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>At last a generation came that walked</span>
						<br/>
						<span>More slowly forward to the common tomb,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then altogether stopped. The women talked</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Excitedly; the men, with eyes agloom</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Looked darkly on them with a look of doom;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And one cried out: "We are immortal now—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How need we these?" And a dread figure stalked,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Silent, with gleaming axe and shrouded brow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all men cried: "Decapitate the women,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or soon there'll be no room to stand or swim in!"</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So (in my dream) each lovely head was chopped</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From its fair shoulders, and but men alone</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were left in all the world. Birth being stopped,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Enough of room remained in every zone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Peace ascended Woman's vacant throne.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thus, life's elixir being found (the quacks</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their bread-and-butter in it gladly sopped)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>'Twas made worth having by the headsman's axe.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Seeing which, I gave myself a hearty shaking,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And crumbled all to powder in the waking.</span>

					<p>
						<span>'Twas a Venerable Person, whom I met one Sunday morning,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">All appareled as a prophet of a melancholy sect;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in a jeremaid of objurgatory warning</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">He lifted up his <i>jodel</i> to the following effect:</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>O ye sanguinary statesmen, intermit your verbal tussles</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">O ye editors and orators, consent to hear my lay!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And a little while the digital and maxillary muscles</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And attend to what a Venerable Person has to say.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Cease your writing, cease your shouting, cease your wild unearthly lying;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Cease to bandy such expressions as are never, never found</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In the letter of a lover; cease "exposing" and "replying"—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Let there be abated fury and a decrement of sound.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>For to-morrow will be Monday and the fifth day of November—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Only day of opportunity before the final rush.</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Carpe diem!</i> go conciliate each person who's a member</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Of the other party—do it while you can without a blush.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>"Lo! the time is close upon you when the madness of the season</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Having howled itself to silence, like a Minnesota 'clone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Will at last be superseded by the still, small voice of reason,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">When the whelpage of your folly you would willingly disown.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>"Ah, 'tis mournful to consider what remorses will be thronging,</span>

						<span class="i1">With a consciousness of having been so ghastly indiscreet,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When by accident untoward two ex-gentlemen belonging</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">To the opposite political denominations meet!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>"Yes, 'tis melancholy, truly, to forecast the fierce, unruly</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Supersurging of their blushes, like the flushes upon high</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When Aurora Borealis lights her circumpolar palace</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And in customary manner sets her banner in the sky.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>"Each will think: 'This falsifier knows that I too am a liar.</span>

						<span class="i1">Would to God that I when little in my victual had been drowned!'"</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Then that Venerable Person went away without returning</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And, the madness of the season having also taken flight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All the people soon were blushing like the skies to crimson burning</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">When Aurora Borealis fires her premises by night.</span>

					<p>
						<span>Goddess of Liberty! O thou</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Whose tearless eyes behold the chain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And look unmoved upon the slain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Eternal peace upon thy brow,—</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Before thy shrine the races press,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Thy perfect favor to implore—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">The proudest tyrant asks no more,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The ironed anarchist no less.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Thine altar-coals that touch the lips</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Of prophets kindle, too, the brand</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">By Discord flung with wanton hand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the houses and the ships.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Upon thy tranquil front the star</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Burns bleak and passionless and white,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Its cold inclemency of light</span>
						<br/>
						<span>More dreadful than the shadows are.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Thy name we do not here invoke</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Our civic rites to sanctify:</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Enthroned in thy remoter sky,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thou heedest not our broken yoke.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Thou carest not for such as we:</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Our millions die to serve the still</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And secret purpose of thy will.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They perish—what is that to thee?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The light that fills the patriot's tomb</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Is not of thee. The shining crown</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Compassionately offered down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To those who falter in the gloom,</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And fall, and call upon thy name,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And die desiring—'tis the sign</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Of a diviner love than thine,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rewarding with a richer fame.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>To him alone let freemen cry</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Who hears alike the victor's shout,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">The song of faith, the moan of doubt,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And bends him from his nearer sky.</span>
					</p>
					<hr/>
					<p>
						<span>God of my country and my race!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">So greater than the gods of old—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">So fairer than the prophets told</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who dimly saw and feared thy face,—</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Who didst but half reveal thy will</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And gracious ends to their desire,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Behind the dawn's advancing fire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thy tender day-beam veiling still,—</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>To whom the unceasing suns belong,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And cause is one with consequence,—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">To whose divine, inclusive sense</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The moan is blended with the song,—</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Whose laws, imperfect and unjust,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Thy just and perfect purpose serve:</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">The needle, howsoe'er it swerve,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still warranting the sailor's trust,—</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>God, lift thy hand and make us free</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">To crown the work thou hast designed.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">O, strike away the chains that bind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Our souls to one idolatry!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The liberty thy love hath given</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">We thank thee for. We thank thee for</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Our great dead fathers' holy war</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wherein our manacles were riven.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>We thank thee for the stronger stroke</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Ourselves delivered and incurred</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">When—thine incitement half unheard—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The chains we riveted we broke.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>We thank thee that beyond the sea</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">The people, growing ever wise,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Turn to the west their serious eyes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And dumbly strive to be as we.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>As when the sun's returning flame</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Upon the Nileside statue shone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And struck from the enchanted stone</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The music of a mighty fame,</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Let Man salute the rising day</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Of Liberty, but not adore.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">'Tis Opportunity—no more—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A useful, not a sacred, ray.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>It bringeth good, it bringeth ill,</span>

						<span class="i1">He maketh it of none effect</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who walketh not within thy will.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Give thou or more or less, as we</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Shall serve the right or serve the wrong.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Confirm our freedom but so long</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As we are worthy to be free.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But when (O, distant be the time!)</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Majorities in passion draw</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Insurgent swords to murder Law,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all the land is red with crime;</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Or—nearer menace!—when the band</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Of feeble spirits cringe and plead</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">To the gigantic strength of Greed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And fawn upon his iron hand;—</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Nay, when the steps to state are worn</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">In hollows by the feet of thieves,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And Mammon sits among the sheaves</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And chuckles while the reapers mourn;</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Then stay thy miracle!—replace</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">The broken throne, repair the chain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Restore the interrupted reign</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And veil again thy patient face.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Lo! here upon the world's extreme</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">We stand with lifted arms and dare</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">By thine eternal name to swear</span>

						<span>Our country, which so fair we deem—</span>

					<h4 epub:type="title">A Morning Fancy</h4>
					<p>
						<span>I drifted (or I seemed to) in a boat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the surface of a shoreless sea</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whereon no ship nor anything did float,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Save only the frail bark supporting me;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And that—it was so shadowy—seemed to be</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Almost from out the very vapors wrought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of the great ocean underneath its keel;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all that blue profound appeared as naught</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But thicker sky, translucent to reveal,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Miles down, whatever through its spaces glided,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or at the bottom traveled or abided.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Great cities there I saw—of rich and poor,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The palace and the hovel; mountains, vales,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Forest and field, the desert and the moor,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tombs of the good and wise who'd lived in jails,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And seas of denser fluid, white with sails</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pushed at by currents moving here and there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And sensible to sight above the flat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of that opaquer deep. Ah, strange and fair</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The nether world that I was gazing at</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With beating heart from that exalted level,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And—lest I founder—trembling like the devil!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The cities all were populous: men swarmed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In public places—chattered, laughed and wept;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And savages their shining bodies warmed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At fires in primal woods. The wild beast leapt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon its prey and slew it as it slept.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Armies went forth to battle on the plain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So far, far down in that unfathomed deep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The living seemed as silent as the slain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor even the widows could be heard to weep.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One might have thought their shaking was but laughter;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, truly, most were married shortly after.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Above the wreckage of that silent fray</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Strange fishes swam in circles, round and round—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Black, double-finned; and once a little way</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A bubble rose and burst without a sound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And a man tumbled out upon the ground.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lord! 'twas an eerie thing to drift apace</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On that pellucid sea, beneath black skies</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And o'er the heads of an undrowning race;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when I woke I said—to her surprise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who came with chocolate, for me to drink it:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>"The atmosphere is deeper than you think it."</span>

						<br/>
						<span>As for wealth we set a wish,</span>

						<span>Sprung from Adam's royal line,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Town of Dae by the sea,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Divers kinds of kings there be.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Name nor fame had Picklepip:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ne'er a soldier nor a ship</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bore his banners in the sun;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Naught knew he of kingly sport,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And he held his royal court</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Under an inverted tun.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Love and roses, ages through,</span>

						<span class="i1">Bloom where cot and trellis stand;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Never yet these blossoms grew—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Never yet was room for two—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">In a cask upon the strand.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So it happened, as it ought,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That his simple schemes he wrought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through the lagging summer's day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In a solitary way.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So it happened, as was best,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That he took his nightly rest</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">With no dreadful incubus</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This way eyed and that way tressed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Featured thus, and thus, and so,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lying lead-like on a breast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By cares of state enough oppressed.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet in dreams his fancies rude</span>

						<span>Once to cask himself away</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He prepared at close of day.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As he tugged with swelling throat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At a most unkingly coat—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not to get it off, but on,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For the serving sun was gone—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Passed a silk-appareled sprite</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Toward her castle on the height,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Seized and set the garment right.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Turned the startled Picklepip—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Splendid crimson cheek and lip!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Turned again to sneak away,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But she bade the villain stay,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bade him thank her, which he did</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With a speech that slipped and slid,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sprawled and stumbled in its gait</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As a dancer tries to skate.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Town of Dae by the sea,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In the face of silk and lace</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Rags too bold should never be.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Lady Minnow cocked her head:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>"Mister Picklepip," she said,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>"Do you ever think to wed?"</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Town of Dae by the sea,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No fair lady ever made a</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Wicked speech like that to me!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Wretched little Picklepip</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Said he hadn't any ship,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Any flocks at his command,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor to feed them any land;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Said he never in his life</span>

						<br/>
						<span>But the guilty stammer so</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That his meaning wouldn't flow;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So he thought his aim to reach</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By some figurative speech:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Said his Fate had been unkind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had pursued him from behind</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">(How the mischief could it else?)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came upon him unaware,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Caught him by the collar—there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gushed the little lady's glee</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Like a gush of golden bells:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>"Picklepip, why, that is <i>me</i>!"</span>

						<span class="i1">Town of Dae by the sea,</span>

						<span>Grammar's for great scholars—she</span>
						<br/>

					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Stupid little Picklepip</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Allowed the subtle hint to slip—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Maundered on about the ship</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That he did not chance to own;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Told this grievance o'er and o'er,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Knowing that she knew before;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Told her how he dwelt alone.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lady Minnow, for reply,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cut him off with "So do I!"</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But she reddened at the fib;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Servitors had she, <i>ad lib.</i></span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Town of Dae by the sea,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In her youth who speaks no truth</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Ne'er shall young and honest be.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Witless little Picklepip</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Manned again his mental ship</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And veered her with a sudden shift.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Painted to the lady's thought</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">How he wrestled and he wrought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stoutly with the swimming drift</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">By the kindly river brought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From the mountain to the sea,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fuel for the town of Dae.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tedious tale for lady's ear:</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">From her castle on the height,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">She had watched her water-knight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through the seasons of a year,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Challenge more than met his view</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And conquer better than he knew.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now she shook her pretty pate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And stamped her foot—'t was growing late:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>"Mister Picklepip, when I</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Drifting seaward pass you by;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When the waves my forehead kiss</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And my tresses float above—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Dead and drowned for lack of love—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You'll be sorry, sir, for this!"</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And the silly creature cried—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Feared, perchance, the rising tide.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Town of Dae by the sea,</span>
						<br/>

						<span>Once I "dipt into the future far as human eye could see,"</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And saw—it was not Sandow, nor John Sullivan, but she—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Emancipated Woman, who was weeping as she ran</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Here and there for the discovery of Expurgated Man.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But the sun of Evolution ever rose and ever set,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And that tardiest of mortals hadn't evoluted yet.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hence the tears that she cascaded, hence the sighs that tore apart</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All the tendinous connections of her indurated heart.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cried Emancipated Woman, as she wearied of the search:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>"In Advancing I have left myself distinctly in the lurch!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Seeking still a worthy partner, from the land of brutes and dudes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I have penetrated rashly into manless solitudes.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now without a mate of any kind where am I?—that's to say,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where shall I be to-morrow?—where exert my rightful sway</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And the purifying strength of my emancipated mind?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Can solitude be lifted up, vacuity refined?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Calling, calling from the shadows in the rear of my Advance—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From the Region of Unprogress in the Dark Domain of Chance—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Long I heard the Unevolvable beseeching my return</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To share the degradation he's reluctant to unlearn.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But I've held my way regardless, evoluting year by year,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till I'm what you now behold me—or would if you were here—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A condensed Emancipation and a Purifier proud</span>
						<br/>
						<span>An Independent Entity appropriately loud!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Independent? Yes, in spirit, but (O, woful, woful state!)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Doomed to premature extinction by privation of a mate—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To extinction or reversion, for Unexpurgated Man</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still awaits me in the backward if I sicken of the van.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>O the horrible dilemma!—to be odiously linked</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With an Undeveloped Species, or become a Type Extinct!"</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As Emancipated Woman wailed her sorrow to the air,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stalking out of desolation came a being strange and rare—</span>

						<span>Plato's Man!—bipedal, featherless from mandible to rump,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Its wings two quilless flippers and its tail a plumeless stump.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>First it scratched and then it clucked, as if in hospitable terms</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It invited her to banquet on imaginary worms.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then it strutted up before her with a lifting of the head,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in accents of affection and of sympathy it said:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>"My estate is some'at 'umble, but I'm qualified to draw</span>

						<span>Near the hymeneal altar and whack up my heart and claw</span>

						<span>Within the vantage of whose greater maw's</span>

						<span>With a Methodist hymn in his musical throat,</span>

						<span>His quivering larynx enwrinkled the sea</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like an Ichthyosaurian blowing his tea;</span>

						<span>When sweetly and pensively rattled and rang</span>

					<p>
						<span>“O, Camomile, Calabash, Cartilage-pie,</span>

						<span>Spread for my spirit a peppermint fry;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Crown me with doughnuts, and drape me with cheese,</span>

						<span>Settle my soul with a codliver sneeze.</span>

						<span>Ropes in his ringlets, eggs in his eyes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tip-tilted nose in a way to surprise.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These the conundrums he flung to the breeze,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The answers that Echo returned to him these:</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i1">“Cobblestone, Cobblestone, why do you sigh—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Why do you turn on the tears?”</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">“My mother is crazy on strawberry jam,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">And my father has petrified ears.”</span>
					</p>

						<span class="i1">Plucking peanuts ready roasted from the branches of the oak,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Waking echoes in the forest with our hymns of blessed bosh,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">We roamed—my love and I.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i1">By the margin of the fountain spouting thick with clabbered milk,</span>

					<h4 epub:type="title">Communing with Nature</h4>
					<p>
						<span>One evening I sat on a heavenward hill,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The winds were asleep and all nature was still,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wee children came round me to play at my knee,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As my mind floated rudderless over the sea.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I put out one hand to caress them, but held</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With the other my nose, for these cherubim smelled.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I cast a few glances upon the old sun;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He was red in the face from the race he had run,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But he seemed to be doing, for aught I could see,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Quite well without any assistance from me.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And so I directed my wandering eye</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Around to the opposite side of the sky,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And the rapture that ever with ecstasy thrills</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through the heart as the moon rises bright from the hills,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Would in this case have been most exceedingly rare,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Except for the fact that the moon was not there.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But the stars looked right lovingly down in the sea,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, by Jupiter, Venus was winking at me!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The gas in the city was flaring up bright,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Montgomery Street was resplendent with light;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But I did not exactly appear to advance</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A sentiment proper to that circumstance.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So it only remains to explain to the town</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That a rainstorm came up before I could come down.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As the boots I had on were uncommonly thin</span>
						<br/>
						<span>My fancy leaked out as the water leaked in.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though dampened my ardour, though slackened my strain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I’ll “strike the wild lyre” who sings the sweet rain!</span>

					<p>
						<span>Old Zephyr, dawdling in the West,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Looked down upon the sea,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which slept unfretted at his feet,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And balanced on its breast a fleet</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That seemed almost to be</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Suspended in the middle air,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As if a magnet held it there,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Eternally at rest.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then, one by one, the ships released</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their folded sails, and strove</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against the empty calm to press</span>
						<br/>
						<span>North, South, or West, or East,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In vain; the subtle nothingness</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was impotent to move.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ten Zephyr laughed aloud to see:—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“No vessel moves except by me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, heigh—ho! I shall sleep.”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But lo! from out the troubled North</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A tempest strode impatient forth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And trampled white the deep;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sloping ships flew glad away,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Laving their heated sides in spray.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The West then turned him red with wrath,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And to the North he shouted:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Hold there! How dare you cross my path,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As now you are about it?”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The North replied with laboured breath—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His speed no moment slowing:—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“My friend, you’ll never have a path,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unless you take to blowing.”</span>

						<span>Then yawns himself from sheer fatigue.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lifting its finger to the sky,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A marble shaft arrests his eye—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This epitaph, in pompous pride,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Engraven on its polished side:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Perfection of Creation’s plan,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Here resteth Universal Man,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who virtues, segregated wide,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Collated, classed, and codified,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Reduced to practice, taught, explained,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And strict morality maintained.</span>

						<span>Anticipating death, his pelf</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">He lavished on this monolith;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Because he leaves nor kin nor kith</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He rears this tribute to himself,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That Virtue’s fame may never cease.</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Hic jacet</i>—let him rest in peace!”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>With sober eye Jove scanned the shaft,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then turned away and lightly laughed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Poor Man! since I have careless been</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In keeping books to note thy sin,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And thou hast left upon the earth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This faithful record of thy worth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thy final prayer shall now be heard:</span>
