THE KEY NOTE</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  I dreamed I was dreaming one morn as I lay
    In a garden with flowers teeming.
  On an island I lay in a mystical bay,
    In the dream that I dreamed I was dreaming.

  The ghost of a scent&mdash;had it followed me there
    From the place where I truly was resting?
  It filled like an anthem the aisles of the air,
    The presence of roses attesting.

  Yet I thought in the dream that I dreamed I dreamed
    That the place was all barren of roses&mdash;
  That it only seemed; and the place, I deemed,
    Was the Isle of Bewildered Noses.

  Full many a seaman had testified
    How all who sailed near were enchanted,
  And landed to search (and in searching died)
    For the roses the Sirens had planted.

  For the Sirens were dead, and the billows boomed
    In the stead of their singing forever;
  But the roses bloomed on the graves of the doomed,
    Though man had discovered them never.

  I thought in my dream 'twas an idle tale,
    A delusion that mariners cherished&mdash;
  That the fragrance loading the conscious gale
    Was the ghost of a rose long perished.

  I said, "I will fly from this island of woes."
    And acting on that decision,
  By that odor of rose I was led by the nose,
    For 'twas truly, ah! truly, Elysian.

  I ran, in my madness, to seek out the source
    Of the redolent river&mdash;directed
  By some supernatural, sinister force
    To a forest, dark, haunted, infected.

  And still as I threaded ('twas all in the dream
    That I dreamed I was dreaming) each turning
  There were many a scream and a sudden gleam
    Of eyes all uncannily burning!

  The leaves were all wet with a horrible dew
    That mirrored the red moon's crescent,
  And all shapes were fringed with a ghostly blue,
    Dim, wavering, phosphorescent.

  But the fragrance divine, coming strong and free,
    Led me on, though my blood was clotting,
  Till&mdash;ah, joy!&mdash;I could see, on the limbs of a tree,
    Mine enemies hanging and rotting!

CAIN</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Lord, shed thy light upon his desert path,
    And gild his branded brow, that no man spill
    His forfeit life to balk thy holy will
  That spares him for the ripening of wrath.

  Already, lo! the red sign is descried,
    To trembling jurors visibly revealed:
    The prison doors obediently yield,
  The baffled hangman flings the cord aside.

  Powell, the brother's blood that marks your trail&mdash;
    Hark, how it cries against you from the ground,
    Like the far baying of the tireless hound.
  Faith! to your ear it is no nightingale.

  What signifies the date upon a stone?
    To-morrow you shall die if not to-day.
    What matter when the Avenger choose to slay
  Or soon or late the Devil gets his own.

  Thenceforth through all eternity you'll hold
    No one advantage of the later death.
    Though you had granted Ralph another breath
  Would <i>he</i> to-day less silent lie and cold?

  Earth cares not, curst assassin, when you die;
    You never will be readier than now.
    Wear, in God's name, that mark upon your brow,
  And keep the life you purchased with a lie!

AN OBITUARIAN</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Death-poet Pickering sat at his desk,
    Wrapped in appropriate gloom;
  His posture was pensive and picturesque,
    Like a raven charming a tomb.

  Enter a party a-drinking the cup
    Of sorrow&mdash;and likewise of woe:
  "Some harrowing poetry, Mister, whack up,
    All wrote in the key of O.

  "For the angels has called my old woman hence
    From the strife (where she fit mighty free).
  It's a nickel a line? Cond&mdash;n the expense!
    For wealth is now little to me."

  The Bard of Mortality looked him through
    In the piercingest sort of a way:
  "It is much to me though it's little to you&mdash;
    I've <i>taken</i> a wife to-day."

  So he twisted the tail of his mental cow
    And made her give down her flow.
  The grief of that bard was long-winded, somehow&mdash;
    There was reams and reamses of woe.

  The widower man which had buried his wife
    Grew lily-like round each gill,
  For she turned in her grave and came back to life&mdash;
    Then he cruel ignored the bill!

  Then Sorrow she opened her gates a-wide,
    As likewise did also Woe,
  And the death-poet's song, as is heard inside,
    Is sang in the key of O.

A COMMUTED SENTENCE</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Boruck and Waterman upon their grills
    In Hades lay, with many a sigh and groan,
    Hotly disputing, for each swore his own
  Were clearly keener than the other's ills.
    And, truly, each had much to boast of&mdash;bone
  And sinew, muscle, tallow, nerve and skin,
  Blood in the vein and marrow in the shin,
    Teeth, eyes and other organs (for the soul
  Has all of these and even a wagging chin)
    Blazing and coruscating like a coal!
  For Lower Sacramento, you remember,
  Has trying weather, even in mid-December.

  Now this occurred in the far future. All
    Mankind had been a million ages dead,
    And each to her reward above had sped,
  Each to his punishment below,&mdash;I call
    That quite a just arrangement. As I said,
  Boruck and Waterman in warmest pain
  Crackled and sizzed with all their might and main.
    For, when on earth, they'd freed a scurvy host
  Of crooks from the State prison, who again
    Had robbed and ravaged the Pacific Coast
  And (such the felon's predatory nature)
  Even got themselves into the Legislature.

  So Waterman and Boruck lay and roared
    In Hades. It is true all other males
    Felt the like flames and uttered equal wails,
  But did not suffer <i>them</i>; whereas <i>they</i> bored
    Each one the other. But indeed my tale's
  Not getting on at all. They lay and browned
  Till Boruck (who long since his teeth had ground
    Away and spoke Gum Arabic and made
  Stump speeches even in praying) looked around
    And said to Bob's incinerated shade:
  "Your Excellency, this is mighty hard on
  The inventors of the unpardonable pardon."

  The other soul&mdash;his right hand all aflame,
    For 'twas with that he'd chiefly sinned, although
    His tongue, too, like a wick was working woe
  To the reserve of tallow in his frame&mdash;
    Said, with a sputtering, uncertain flow,
  And with a gesture like a shaken torch:
  "Yes, but I'm sure we'll not much longer scorch.
    Although this climate is not good for Hope,
  Whose joyous wing 'twould singe, I think the porch
    Of Hell we'll quit with a pacific slope.
  Last century I signified repentance
  And asked for commutation of our sentence."

  Even as he spoke, the form of Satan loomed
    In sight, all crimson with reflections's fire,
    Like some tall tower or cathedral spire
  Touched by the dawn while all the earth is gloomed
    In mists and shadows of the night time. "Sire,"
  Said Waterman, his agitable wick
  Still sputtering, "what calls you back so quick?
    It scarcely was a century ago
  You left us." "I have come to bring," said Nick,
    "St. Peter's answer (he is never slow
  In correspondence) to your application
  For pardon&mdash;pardon me!&mdash;for commutation.

  "He says that he's instructed to reply
    (And he has so instructed me) that sin
    Like yours&mdash;and this poor gentleman's who's in
  For bad advice to you&mdash;comes rather high;
    But since, apparently, you both begin
  To feel some pious promptings to the right,
  And fain would turn your faces to the light,
    Eternity seems all too long a term.
  So 'tis commuted to one-half. I'm quite
    Prepared, when that expires, to free the worm
  And quench the fire." And, civilly retreating,
  He left them holding their protracted meeting.

A LIFTED FINGER</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
      [The <i>Chronicle</i> did a great public service in whipping
      &mdash;&mdash; and his fellow-rascals out of office.&mdash;<i>M.H. de Young's
      Newspaper</i>.]
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  What! <i>you</i> whip rascals?&mdash;<i>you</i>, whose gutter blood
  Bears, in its dark, dishonorable flood,
  Enough of prison-birds' prolific germs
  To serve a whole eternity of terms?
  <i>You</i>, for whose back the rods and cudgels strove
  Ere yet the ax had hewn them from the grove?
  <i>You</i>, the De Young whose splendor bright and brave
  Is phosphorescence from another's grave&mdash;
  Till now unknown, by any chance or luck,
  Even to the hearts at which you, feebly struck?
  <i>You</i> whip a rascal out of office?&mdash;<i>you</i>
  Whose leadless weapon once ignobly blew
  Its smoke in six directions to assert
  Your lack of appetite for others' dirt?

  Practice makes perfect: when for fame you thirst,
  Then whip a rascal. Whip a cripple first.
  Or, if for action you're less free than bold&mdash;
  Your palms both brimming with dishonest gold&mdash;
  Entrust the castigation that you've planned,
  As once before, to woman's idle hand.
  So in your spirit shall two pleasures join
  To slake the sacred thirst for blood and coin.
  Blood? Souls have blood, even as the body hath,
  And, spilled, 'twill fertilize the field of wrath.
  Lo! in a purple gorge of yonder hills,
  Where o'er a grave a bird its day-song stills,
  A woman's blood, through roses ever red,
  Mutely appeals for vengeance on your head.
  Slandered to death to serve a sordid end,
  She called you murderer and called me friend.

  Now, mark you, libeler, this course if you
  Dare to maintain, or rather to renew;
  If one short year's immunity has made
  You blink again the perils of your trade&mdash;
  The ghastly sequence of the maddened "knave,"
  The hot encounter and the colder grave;
  If the grim, dismal lesson you ignore
  While yet the stains are fresh upon your floor,
  And calmly march upon the fatal brink
  With eyes averted to your trail of ink,
  Counting unkind the services of those
  Who pull, to hold you back, your stupid nose,
  The day for you to die is not so far,
  Or, at the least, to live the thing you are!

  Pregnant with possibilities of crime,
  And full of felons for all coming time,
  Your blood's too precious to be lightly spilt
  In testimony to a venial guilt.
  Live to get whelpage and preserve a name
  No praise can sweeten and no lie unshame.
  Live to fulfill the vision that I see
  Down the dim vistas of the time to be:
  A dream of clattering beaks and burning eyes
  Of hungry ravens glooming all the skies;
  A dream of gleaming teeth and foetid breath
  Of jackals wrangling at the feast of death;
  A dream of broken necks and swollen tongues&mdash;
  The whole world's gibbets loaded with De Youngs!

TWO STATESMEN</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  In that fair city by the inland sea,
  Where Blaine unhived his Presidential bee,
  Frank Pixley's meeting with George Gorham sing,
  Celestial muse, and what events did spring
  From the encounter of those mighty sons
  Of thunder, and of slaughter, and of guns.
  Great Gorham first, his yearning tooth to sate
  And give him stomach for the day's debate,
  Entering a restaurant, with eager mien,
  Demands an ounce of bacon and a bean.
  The trembling waiter, by the statesman's eye
  Smitten with terror, hastens to comply;
  Nor chairs nor tables can his speed retard,
  For famine's fixed and horrible regard
  He takes for menace. As he shaking flew,
  Lo! the portentous Pixley heaved in view!
  Before him yawned invisible the cell,
  Unheard, behind, the warden's footsteps fell.
  Thrice in convention rising to his feet,
  He thrice had been thrust back into his seat;
  Thrice had protested, been reminded thrice
  The nation had no need of his advice.
  Balked of his will to set the people right,
  His soul was gloomy though his hat was white,
  So fierce his mien, with provident accord
  The waiters swarmed him, thinking him a lord.
  He spurned them, roaring grandly to their chief:
  "Give me (Fred. Crocker pays) a leg of beef!"
  His wandering eye's deluminating flame
  Fell upon Gorham and the crisis came!
  For Pixley scowled and darkness filled the room
  Till Gorham's flashing orbs dispelled the gloom.
  The patrons of the place, by fear dismayed,
  Sprang to the street and left their scores unpaid.
  So, when Jove thunders and his lightnings gleam
  To sour the milk and curdle, too, the cream,
  And storm-clouds gather on the shadowed hill,
  The ass forsakes his hay, the pig his swill.
  Hotly the heroes now engaged&mdash;their breath
  Came short and hard, as in the throes of death.
  They clenched their hands, their weapons brandished high,
  Cut, stabbed, and hewed, nor uttered any cry,
  But gnashed their teeth and struggled on! In brief,
  One ate his bacon, t'other one his beef.

MATTER FOR GRATITUDE</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
      [Especially should we be thankful for having escaped the
      ravages of the yellow scourge by which our neighbors have
      been so sorely afflicted.&mdash;<i>Governor Stoneman's Thanksgiving
      Proclamation.</i>]
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Be pleased, O Lord, to take a people's thanks
  That Thine avenging sword has spared our ranks&mdash;
  That Thou hast parted from our lips the cup
  And forced our neighbors' lips to drink it up.
  Father of Mercies, with a heart contrite
  We thank Thee that Thou goest south to smite,
  And sparest San Francisco's loins, to crack
  Thy lash on Hermosillo's bleeding back&mdash;
  That o'er our homes Thine awful angel spread
  His wings in vain, and Guaymas weeps instead.

  We praise Thee, God, that Yellow Fever here
  His horrid banner has not dared to rear,
  Consumption's jurisdiction to contest,
  Her dagger deep in every second breast!
  Catarrh and Asthma and Congestive Chill
  Attest Thy bounty and perform Thy will.
  These native messengers obey Thy call&mdash;
  They summon singly, but they summon all.
  Not, as in Mexico's impested clime,
  Can Yellow Jack commit recurring crime.
  We thank Thee that Thou killest all the time.

  Thy tender mercies, Father, never end:
  Upon all heads Thy blessings still descend,
  Though their forms vary. Here the sown seeds yield
  Abundant grain that whitens all the field&mdash;
  There the smit corn stands barren on the plain,
  Thrift reaps the straw and Famine gleans in vain.
  Here the fat priest to the contented king
  Points out the contrast and the people sing&mdash;
  There mothers eat their offspring. Well, at least
  Thou hast provided offspring for the feast.
  An earthquake here rolls harmless through the land,
  And Thou art good because the chimneys stand&mdash;
  There templed cities sink into the sea,
  And damp survivors, howling as they flee,
  Skip to the hills and hold a celebration
  In honor of Thy wise discrimination.

  O God, forgive them all, from Stoneman down,
  Thy smile who construe and expound Thy frown,
  And fall with saintly grace upon their knees
  To render thanks when Thou dost only sneeze.

THREE KINDS OF A ROGUE</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  I

  Sharon, ambitious of immortal shame,
  Fame's dead-wall daubed with his illustrious name&mdash;
  Served in the Senate, for our sins, his time,
  Each word a folly and each vote a crime;
  Law for our governance well skilled to make
  By knowledge gained in study how to break;
  Yet still by the presiding eye ignored,
  Which only sought him when too loud he snored.
  Auspicious thunder!&mdash;when he woke to vote
  He stilled his own to cut his country's throat;
  That rite performed, fell off again to sleep,
  While statesmen ages dead awoke to weep!
  For sedentary service all unfit,
  By lying long disqualified to sit,
  Wasting below as he decayed aloft,
  His seat grown harder as his brain grew soft,
  He left the hall he could not bring away,
  And grateful millions blessed the happy day!
  Whate'er contention in that hall is heard,
  His sovereign State has still the final word:
  For disputatious statesmen when they roar
  Startle the ancient echoes of his snore,
  Which from their dusty nooks expostulate
  And close with stormy clamor the debate.
  To low melodious thunders then they fade;
  Their murmuring lullabies all ears invade;
  Peace takes the Chair; the portal Silence keeps;
  No motion stirs the dark Lethean deeps&mdash;
  Washoe has spoken and the Senate sleeps.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  II

  Lo! the new Sharon with a new intent,
  Making no laws, but keen to circumvent
  The laws of Nature (since he can't repeal)
  That break his failing body on the wheel.
  As Tantalus again and yet again
  The elusive wave endeavors to restrain
  To slake his awful thirst, so Sharon tries
  To purchase happiness that age denies;
  Obtains the shadow, but the substance goes,
  And hugs the thorn, but cannot keep the rose;
  For Dead Sea fruits bids prodigally, eats,
  And then, with tardy reformation&mdash;cheats.
  Alert his faculties as three score years
  And four score vices will permit, he nears&mdash;
  Dicing with Death&mdash;the finish of the game,
  And curses still his candle's wasting flame,
  The narrow circle of whose feeble glow
  Dims and diminishes at every throw.
  Moments his losses, pleasures are his gains,
  Which even in his grasp revert to pains.
  The joy of grasping them alone remains.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  III

  Ring up the curtain and the play protract!
  Behold our Sharon in his last mad act.
  With man long warring, quarreling with God,
  He crouches now beneath a woman's rod
  Predestined for his back while yet it lay
  Closed in an acorn which, one luckless day,
  He stole, unconscious of its foetal twig,
  From the scant garner of a sightless pig.
  With bleeding shoulders pitilessly scored,
  He bawls more lustily than once he snored.
  The sympathetic Comstocks droop to hear,
  And Carson river sheds a viscous tear,
  Which sturdy tumble-bugs assail amain,
  With ready thrift, and urge along the plain.
  The jackass rabbit sorrows as he lopes;
  The sage-brush glooms along the mountain slopes;
  In rising clouds the poignant alkali,
  Tearless itself, makes everybody cry.
  Washoe canaries on the Geiger Grade
  Subdue the singing of their cavalcade,
  And, wiping with their ears the tears unshed,
  Grieve for their family's unlucky head.
  Virginia City intermits her trade
  And well-clad strangers walk her streets unflayed.
  Nay, all Nevada ceases work to weep
  And the recording angel goes to sleep.
  But in his dreams his goose-quill's creaking fount
  Augments the debits in the long account.
  And still the continents and oceans ring
  With royal torments of the Silver King!
  Incessant bellowings fill all the earth,
  Mingled with inextinguishable mirth.
  He roars, men laugh, Nevadans weep, beasts howl,
  Plash the affrighted fish, and shriek the fowl!
  With monstrous din their blended thunders rise,
  Peal upon peal, and brawl along the skies,
  Startle in hell the Sharons as they groan,
  And shake the splendors of the great white throne!
  Still roaring outward through the vast profound,
  The spreading circles of receding sound
  Pursue each other in a failing race
  To the cold confines of eternal space;
  There break and die along that awful shore
  Which God's own eyes have never dared explore&mdash;
  Dark, fearful, formless, nameless evermore!

  Look to the west! Against yon steely sky
  Lone Mountain rears its holy cross on high.
  About its base the meek-faced dead are laid
  To share the benediction of its shade.
  With crossed white hands, shut eyes and formal feet,
  Their nights are innocent, their days discreet.
  Sharon, some years, perchance, remain of life&mdash;
  Of vice and greed, vulgarity and strife;
  And then&mdash;God speed the day if such His will&mdash;
  You'll lie among the dead you helped to kill,
  And be in good society at last,
  Your purse unsilvered and your face unbrassed.

A MAN</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Pennoyer, Governor of Oregon,
  Casting to South his eye across the bourne
  Of his dominion (where the Palmiped,
  With leathers 'twixt his toes, paddles his marsh,
  Amphibious) saw a rising cloud of hats,
  And heard a faint, far sound of distant cheers
  Below the swell of the horizon. "Lo,"
  Cried one, "the President! the President!"
  All footed webwise then took up the word&mdash;
  The hill tribes and the tribes lacustrine and
  The folk riparian and littoral,
  Cried with one voice: "The President! He comes!"
  And some there were who flung their headgear up
  In emulation of the Southern mob;
  While some, more soberly disposed, stood still
  And silently had fits; and others made
  Such reverent genuflexions as they could,
  Having that climate in their bones. Then spake
  The Court Dunce, humbly, as became him: "Sire,
  If thou, as heretofore thou hast, wilt deign
  To reap advantage of a fool's advice
  By action ordered after nature's way,
  As in thy people manifest (for still
  Stupidity's the only wisdom) thou
  Wilt get thee straight unto to the border land
  To mark the President's approach with such
  Due, decent courtesy as it shall seem
  We have in custom the best warrant for."

  Pennoyer, Governor of Oregon,
  Eyeing the storm of hats which darkened all
  The Southern sky, and hearing far hurrahs
  Of an exulting people, answered not.
  Then some there were who fell upon their knees,
  And some upon their Governor, and sought
  Each in his way, by blandishment or force,
  To gain his action to their end. "Behold,"
  They said, "thy brother Governor to South
  Met him even at the gateway of his realm,
  Crook-kneed, magnetic-handed and agrin,
  Backed like a rainbow&mdash;all things done in form
  Of due observance and respect. Shall we
  Alone of all his servitors refuse
  Swift welcome to our master and our lord?"

  Pennoyer, Governor of Oregon,
  Answered them not, but turned his back to them
  And as if speaking to himself, the while
  He started to retire, said: "He be damned!"

  To that High Place o'er Portland's central block,
  Where the Recording Angel stands to view
  The sinning world, nor thinks to move his feet
  Aside and look below, came flocking up
  Inferior angels, all aghast, and cried:
  "Pennoyer, Governor of Oregon,
  Has said, O what an awful word!&mdash;too bad
  To be by us repeated!" "Yes, I know,"
  Said the superior bird&mdash;"I heard it too,
  And have already booked it. Pray observe."
  Splitting the giant tome, whose covers fell
  Apart, o'ershadowing to right and left
  The Eastern and the Western world, he showed
  The newly written entry, black and big,
  Upon the credit side of thine account,
  Pennoyer, Governor of Oregon.

POSTERITY'S AWARD</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  I'd long been dead, but I returned to earth.
    Some small affairs posterity was making
  A mess of, and I came to see that worth
    Received its dues. I'd hardly finished waking,
  The grave-mould still upon me, when my eye
  Perceived a statue standing straight and high.

  'Twas a colossal figure&mdash;bronze and gold&mdash;
    Nobly designed, in attitude commanding.
  A toga from its shoulders, fold on fold,
    Fell to the pedestal on which 'twas standing.
  Nobility it had and splendid grace,
  And all it should have had&mdash;except a face!

  It showed no features: not a trace nor sign
    Of any eyes or nose could be detected&mdash;
  On the smooth oval of its front no line
    Where sites for mouths are commonly selected.
  All blank and blind its faulty head it reared.
  Let this be said: 'twas generously eared.

  Seeing these things, I straight began to guess
    For whom this mighty image was intended.
  "The head," I cried, "is Upton's, and the dress
    Is Parson Bartlett's own." True, <i>his</i> cloak ended
  Flush with his lowest vertebra, but no
  Sane sculptor ever made a toga so.

  Then on the pedestal these words I read:
    "<i>Erected Eighteen Hundred Ninety-seven</i>"
  (Saint Christofer! how fast the time had sped!
    Of course it naturally does in Heaven)
  "<i>To</i> &mdash;&mdash;" (here a blank space for the name began)
  "<i>The Nineteenth Century's Great Foremost Man</i>!"

  "<i>Completed</i>" the inscription ended, "<i>in
    The Year Three Thousand</i>"&mdash;which was just arriving.
  By Jove! thought I, 'twould make the founders grin
    To learn whose fame so long has been surviving&mdash;
  To read the name posterity will place
  In that blank void, and view the finished face.

  Even as I gazed, the year Three Thousand came,
    And then by acclamation all the people
  Decreed whose was our century's best fame;
    Then scaffolded the statue like a steeple,
  To make the likeness; and the name was sunk
  Deep in the pedestal's metallic trunk.

  Whose was it? Gentle reader, pray excuse
    The seeming rudeness, but I can't consent to
  Be so forehanded with important news.
    'Twas neither yours nor mine&mdash;let that content you.
  If not, the name I must surrender, which,
  Upon a dead man's word, was George K. Fitch!

THE SPIRIT OF A SPONGE</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  I dreamed one night that Stephen Massett died,
  And for admission up at Heaven applied.
  "Who are you?" asked St. Peter. Massett said:
  "Jeems Pipes, of Pipesville." Peter bowed his head,
  Opened the gates and said: "I'm glad to know you,
  And wish we'd something better, sir, to show you."
  "Don't mention it," said Stephen, looking bland,
  And was about to enter, hat in hand,
  When from a cloud below such fumes arose
  As tickled tenderly his conscious nose.
  He paused, replaced his hat upon his head,
  Turned back and to the saintly warden said,
  O'er his already sprouting wings: "I swear
  I smell some broiling going on down there!"
  So Massett's paunch, attracted by the smell,
  Followed his nose and found a place in Hell.

TO E.S. SALOMON</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
      Who in a Memorial Day oration protested bitterly against
      decorating the graves of Confederate dead.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  What! Salomon! such words from you,
    Who call yourself a soldier? Well,
    The Southern brother where he fell
  Slept all your base oration through.

  Alike to him&mdash;he cannot know
    Your praise or blame: as little harm
    Your tongue can do him as your arm
  A quarter-century ago.

  The brave respect the brave. The brave
    Respect the dead; but <i>you</i>&mdash;you draw
    That ancient blade, the ass's jaw,
  And shake it o'er a hero's grave.

  Are you not he who makes to-day
    A merchandise of old renown
    Which he persuades this easy town
  He won in battle far away?

  Nay, those the fallen who revile
    Have ne'er before the living stood
    And stoutly made their battle good
  And greeted danger with a smile.

  What if the dead whom still you hate
    Were wrong? Are you so surely right?
    We know the issue of the fight&mdash;
  The sword is but an advocate.

  Men live and die, and other men
    Arise with knowledges diverse:
    What seemed a blessing seems a curse,
  And Now is still at odds with Then.

  The years go on, the old comes back
    To mock the new&mdash;beneath the sun.
    Is <i>nothing</i> new; ideas run
  Recurrent in an endless track.

  What most we censure, men as wise
    Have reverently practiced; nor
    Will future wisdom fail to war
  On principles we dearly prize.

  We do not know&mdash;we can but deem,
    And he is loyalest and best
    Who takes the light full on his breast
  And follows it throughout the dream.

  The broken light, the shadows wide&mdash;
    Behold the battle-field displayed!
    God save the vanquished from the blade,
  The victor from the victor's pride!

  If, Salomon, the blessed dew
    That falls upon the Blue and Gray
    Is powerless to wash away
  The sin of differing from you.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Remember how the flood of years
    Has rolled across the erring slain;
    Remember, too, the cleansing rain
  Of widows' and of orphans' tears.

  The dead are dead&mdash;let that atone:
    And though with equal hand we strew
    The blooms on saint and sinner too,
  Yet God will know to choose his own.

  The wretch, whate'er his life and lot,
    Who does not love the harmless dead
    With all his heart and all his head&mdash;
  May God forgive him&mdash;<i>I</i> shall not.

  When, Salomon, you come to quaff
    The Darker Cup with meeker face,
    I, loving you at last, shall trace
  Upon your tomb this epitaph:

  "Draw near, ye generous and brave&mdash;
    Kneel round this monument and weep:
    It covers one who tried to keep
  A flower from a dead man's grave."

FINIS FTERNITATIS</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Strolling at sunset in my native land,
  With fruits and flowers thick on either hand,
      I crossed a Shadow flung athwart my way,
  Emerging on a waste of rock and sand.

  "The apples all are gone from here," I said,
  "The roses perished and their spirits fled.
      I will go back." A voice cried out: "The man
  Is risen who eternally was dead!"

  I turned and saw an angel standing there,
  Newly descended from the heights of air.
      Sweet-eyed compassion filled his face, his hands
  A naked sword and golden trumpet bare.

  "Nay, 'twas not death, the shadow that I crossed,"
  I said. "Its chill was but a touch of frost.
      It made me gasp, but quickly I came through,
  With breath recovered ere it scarce was lost."

  'Twas the same land! Remembered mountains thrust
  Grayed heads asky, and every dragging gust,
      In ashen valleys where my sons had reaped,
  Stirred in familiar river-beds the dust.

  Some heights, where once the traveler was shown
  The youngest and the proudest city known,
      Lifted smooth ridges in the steely light&mdash;
  Bleak, desolate acclivities of stone.

  Where I had worshiped at my father's tomb,
  Within a massive temple's awful gloom,
      A jackal slunk along the naked rock,
  Affrighted by some prescience of doom.

  Man's vestiges were nowhere to be found,
  Save one brass mausoleum on a mound
      (I knew it well) spared by the artist Time
  To emphasize the desolation round.

  Into the stagnant sea the sullen sun
  Sank behind bars of crimson, one by one.
      "Eternity's at hand!" I cried aloud.
  "Eternity," the angel said, "is done.

  For man is ages dead in every zone;
  The angels all are dead but I alone;
      The devils, too, are cold enough at last,
  And God lies dead before the great white throne!

  'Tis foreordained that I bestride the shore
  When all are gone (as Gabriel did before,
      When I had throttled the last man alive)
  And swear Eternity shall be no more."

  "O Azrael&mdash;O Prince of Death, declare
  Why conquered I the grave?" I cried. "What rare,
      Conspicuous virtues won this boon for me?"
  "You've been revived," he said, "to hear me swear."

  "Then let me creep again beneath the grass,
  And knock thou at yon pompous tomb of brass.
       If ears are what you want, Charles Crocker's there&mdash;
  Betwixt the greatest ears, the greatest ass."

  He rapped, and while the hollow echoes rang,
  Out at the door a curst hyena sprang
       And fled! Said Azrael: "His soul's escaped,"
  And closed the brazen portal with a bang.

  Goldenson hanged! Well, Heaven forbid

  It can't be wrong, though, to rejoice
    That his unpleasing capers
  Are ended. Silent is his voice
    In all the papers.

  No longer he's a show: no more,
    Bear-like, his den he's walking.
  No longer can he hold the floor
    When I'd be talking.

  The laws that govern jails are bad
    If such displays are lawful.
  The fate of the assassin's sad,

  What! shall a wretch condemned to die

THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF A SOUL</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  What! Pixley, must I hear you call the roll
  Of all the vices that infest your soul?
  Was't not enough that lately you did bawl
  Your money-worship in the ears of all?[A]
  Still must you crack your brazen cheek to tell
  That though a miser you're a sot as well?
  Still must I hear how low your taste has sunk&mdash;
  From getting money down to getting drunk?[B]

  Who worships money, damning all beside,
  And shows his callous knees with pious pride,
  Speaks with half-knowledge, for no man e'er scorns
  His own possessions, be they coins or corns.
  You've money, neighbor; had you gentle birth
  You'd know, as now you never can, its worth.

  You've money; learning is beyond your scope,
  Deaf to your envy, stubborn to your hope.
  But if upon your undeserving head
  Science and letters had their glory shed;
  If in the cavern of your skull the light
  Of knowledge shone where now eternal night
  Breeds the blind, poddy, vapor-fatted naughts
  Of cerebration that you think are thoughts&mdash;
  Black bats in cold and dismal corners hung
  That squeak and gibber when you move your tongue&mdash;
  You would not write, in Avarice's defense,
  A senseless eulogy on lack of sense,
  Nor show your eagerness to sacrifice
  All noble virtues to one loathsome vice.

  You've money; if you'd manners too you'd shame
  To boast your weakness or your baseness name.
  Appraise the things you have, but measure not
  The things denied to your unhappy lot.
  He values manners lighter than a cork
  Who combs his beard at table with a fork.
  Hare to seek sin and tortoise to forsake,
  The laws of taste condemn you to the stake
  To expiate, where all the world may see,
  The crime of growing old disgracefully.

  Religion, learning, birth and manners, too,
  All that distinguishes a man from you,
  Pray damn at will: all shining virtues gain
  An added luster from a rogue's disdain.
  But spare the young that proselyting sin,
  A toper's apotheosis of gin.
  If not our young, at least our pigs may claim
  Exemption from the spectacle of shame!

  Are you not he who lately out of shape
  Blew a brass trumpet to denounce the grape?&mdash;
  Who led the brave teetotalers afield
  And slew your leader underneath your shield?&mdash;
  Swore that no man should drink unless he flung
  Himself across your body at the bung?
  Who vowed if you'd the power you would fine
  The Son of God for making water wine?

  All trails to odium you tread and boast,
  Yourself enamored of the dirtiest most.
  One day to be a miser you aspire,
  The next to wallow drunken in the mire;
  The third, lo! you're a meritorious liar![C]
  Pray, in the catalogue of all your graces,
  Have theft and cowardice no honored places?

  Yield thee, great Satan&mdash;here's a rival name
  With all thy vices and but half thy shame!
  Quick to the letter of the precept, quick
  To the example of the elder Nick;
  With as great talent as was e'er applied
  To fool a teacher and to fog a guide;
  With slack allegiance and boundless greed,
  To paunch the profit of a traitor deed,
  He aims to make thy glory all his own,
  And crowd his master from the infernal throne!

FAMINE'S REALM</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  To him in whom the love of Nature has
  Imperfectly supplanted the desire
  And dread necessity of food, your shore,
  Fair Oakland, is a terror. Over all
  Your sunny level, from Tamaletown
  To where the Pestuary's fragrant slime,
  With dead dogs studded, bears its ailing fleet,
  Broods the still menace of starvation. Bones
  Of men and women bleach along the ways
  And pampered vultures sleep upon the trees.
  It is a land of death, and Famine there
  Holds sovereignty; though some there be her sway
  Who challenge, and intrenched in larders live,
  Drawing their sustentation from abroad.
  But woe to him, the stranger! He shall die
  As die the early righteous in the bud
  And promise of their prime. He, venturesome
  To penetrate the wilds rectangular
  Of grass-grown ways luxuriant of blooms,
  Frequented of the bee and of the blithe,
  Bold squirrel, strays with heedless feet afar
  From human habitation and is lost
  In mid-Broadway. There hunger seizes him,
  And (careless man! deeming God's providence
  Extends so far) he has not wherewithal
  To bate its urgency. Then, lo! appears
  A mealery&mdash;a restaurant&mdash;a place
  Where poison battles famine, and the two,
  Like fish-hawks warring in the upper sky
  For that which one has taken from the deep,
  Manage between them to dispatch the prey.
  He enters and leaves hope behind. There ends
  His history. Anon his bones, clean-picked

  Incautious) line the highway. O, my friends,
  Of all felonious and deadlywise
  Devices of the Enemy of Souls,
  Planted along the ways of life to snare
  Man's mortal and immortal part alike,
  The Oakland restaurant is chief. It lives
  That man may die. It flourishes that life
  May wither. Its foundation stones repose
  On human hearts and hopes. I've seen in it
  Crabs stewed in milk and salad offered up
  With dressing so unholily compound
  That it included flour and sugar! Yea,

THE MACKAIAD</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Mackay's hot wrath to Bonynge, direful spring
  Of blows unnumbered, heavenly goddess, sing&mdash;
  That wrath which hurled to Hellman's office floor
  Two heroes, mutually smeared with gore,
  Whose hair in handfuls marked the dire debate,
  And riven coat-tails testified their hate.
  Sing, muse, what first their indignation fired,
  What words augmented it, by whom inspired.

  First, the great Bonynge comes upon the scene
  And asks the favor of the British Queen.
  Suppliant he stands and urges all his claim:
  His wealth, his portly person and his name,
  His habitation in the setting sun,
  As child of nature; and his suit he won.
  No more the Sovereign, wearied with his plea,
  From slumber's chain her faculties can free.
  Low and more low the royal eyelids creep,
  She gives the assenting nod and falls asleep.
  Straightway the Bonynges all invade the Court
  And telegraph the news to every port.
  Beneath the seas, red-hot, the tidings fly,
  The cables crinkle and the fishes fry!
  The world, awaking like a startled bat,
  Exclaims: "A Bonynge? What the devil's that?"
  Mackay, meanwhile, to envy all attent,
  Untaught to spare, unable to relent,
  Walks in our town on needles and on pins,
  And in a mean, revengeful spirit&mdash;grins!

  Sing, muse, what next to break the peace occurred&mdash;
  What act uncivil, what unfriendly word?
  The god of Bosh ascending from his pool,
  Where since creation he has played the fool,
  Clove the blue slush, as other gods the sky,
  And, waiting but a moment's space to dry,
  Touched Bonynge with his finger-tip. "O son,"
  He said, "alike of nature and a gun,
  Knowest not Mackay's insufferable sin?
  Hast thou not heard that he doth stand and grin?
  Arise! assert thy manhood, and attest
  The uncommercial spirit in thy breast.
  Avenge thine honor, for by Jove I swear
  Thou shalt not else be my peculiar care!"
  He spake, and ere his worshiper could kneel
  Had dived into his slush pool, head and heel.
  Full of the god and to revenges nerved,
  And conscious of a will that never swerved,
  Bonynge set sail: the world beyond the wave
  As gladly took him as the other gave.
  New York received him, but a shudder ran
  Through all the western coast, which knew the man;
  And science said that the seismic action
  Was owing to an asteroid's impaction.

  O goddess, sing what Bonynge next essayed.
  Did he unscabbard the avenging blade,
  The long spear brandish and porrect the shield,
  Havoc the town and devastate the field?
  His sacred thirst for blood did he allay
  By halving the unfortunate Mackay?
  Small were the profit and the joy to him
  To hew a base-born person, limb from limb.
  Let vulgar souls to low revenge incline,
  That of diviner spirits is divine.
  Bonynge at noonday stood in public places
  And (with regard to the Mackays) made faces!
  Before those formidable frowns and scowls
  The dogs fled, tail-tucked, with affrighted howls,
  And horses, terrified, with flying feet
  O'erthrew the apple-stands along the street,
  Involving the metropolis in vast
  Financial ruin! Man himself, aghast,
  Retreated east and west and north and south
  Before the menace of that twisted mouth,
  Till Jove, in answer to their prayers, sent Night
  To veil the dreadful visage from their sight!

  Such were the causes of the horrid strife&mdash;
  The mother-wrongs which nourished it to life.
  O, for a quill from an archangel's wing!
  O, for a voice that's adequate to sing
  The splendor and the terror of the fray,
  The scattered hair, the coat-tails all astray,
  The parted collars and the gouts of gore
  Reeking and smoking on the banker's floor,
  The interlocking limbs, embraces dire,
  Revolving bodies and deranged attire!

  Vain, vain the trial: 'tis vouchsafed to none
  To sing two millionaires rolled into one!
  My hand and pen their offices refuse,
  And hoarse and hoarser grows the weary muse.
  Alone remains, to tell of the event,
  Abandoned, lost and variously rent,
  The Bonynge nethermost habiliment.

  But best felicity is his thy praise
  Who utters unaware in works and ways&mdash;
  Who <i>laborare est orare</i> proves,
  And feels thy suasion wheresoe'er he moves,
  Serving thy purpose, not thine altar, still,
  And working, for he thinks it his, thy will.
  If such a life with blessings be not fraught,
  I envy Peter Robertson for naught.

A POET'S FATHER</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Welcker, I'm told, can boast a father great
  And honored in the service of the State.
  Public Instruction all his mind employs&mdash;
  He guides its methods and its wage enjoys.
  Prime Pedagogue, imperious and grand,
  He waves his ferule o'er a studious land
  Where humming youth, intent upon the page,
  Thirsting for knowledge with a noble rage,
  Drink dry the whole Pierian spring and ask
  To slake their fervor at his private flask.
  Arrested by the terror of his frown,
  The vaulting spit-ball drops untimely down;
  The fly impaled on the tormenting pin
  Stills in his awful glance its dizzy din;
  Beneath that stern regard the chewing-gum
  Which writhed and squeaked between the teeth is dumb;
  Obedient to his will the dunce-cap flies
  To perch upon the brows of the unwise;
  The supple switch forsakes the parent wood
  To settle where 'twill do the greatest good,
  Puissant still, as when of old it strove
  With Solomon for spitting on the stove
  Learned Professor, variously great,
  Guide, guardian, instructor of the State&mdash;
  Quick to discern and zealous to correct
  The faults which mar the public intellect
  From where of Siskiyou the northern bound
  Is frozen eternal to the sunless ground
  To where in San Diego's torrid clime
  The swarthy Greaser swelters in his grime&mdash;
  Beneath your stupid nose can you not see
  The dunce whom once you dandled on your knee?
  O mighty master of a thousand schools,
  Stop teaching wisdom, or stop breeding fools.

A COWARD</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  When Pickering, distressed by an "attack,"
  Has the strange insolence to answer back
  He hides behind a name that is a lie,
  And out of shadow falters his reply.
  God knows him, though&mdash;identified alike
  By hardihood to rise and fear to strike,
  And fitly to rebuke his sins decrees,
  That, hide from others with what care he please,
  Night sha'n't be black enough nor earth so wide
  That from himself himself can ever hide!
  Hard fate indeed to feel at every breath
  His burden of identity till death!&mdash;
  No moment's respite from the immortal load,
  To think himself a serpent or a toad,
  Or dream, with a divine, ecstatic glow,
  He's long been dead and canonized a crow!

TO MY LIARS</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Attend, mine enemies of all degrees,
  From sandlot orators and sandlot fleas
  To fallen gentlemen and rising louts
  Who babble slander at your drinking bouts,
  And, filled with unfamiliar wine, begin
  Lies drowned, ere born, in more congenial gin.
  But most attend, ye persons of the press
  Who live (though why, yourselves alone can guess)
  In hope deferred, ambitious still to shine
  By hating me at half a cent a line&mdash;
  Like drones among the bees of brighter wing,
  Sunless to shine and impotent to sting.
  To estimate in easy verse I'll try
  The controversial value of a lie.
  So lend your ears&mdash;God knows you have enough!&mdash;
  I mean to teach, and if I can't I'll cuff.

  A lie is wicked, so the priests declare;
  But that to us is neither here nor there.
  'Tis worse than wicked, it is vulgar too;
  <i>N'importe</i>&mdash;with that we've nothing here to do.
  If 'twere artistic I would lie till death,
  And shape a falsehood with my latest breath.
  Parrhasius never more did pity lack,
  The while his model writhed upon the rack,
  Than I for my collaborator's pain,
  Who, stabbed with fibs again and yet again,
  Would vainly seek to move my stubborn heart
  If slander were, and wit were not, an art.
  The ill-bred and illiterate can lie
  As fast as you, and faster far than I.
  Shall I compete, then, in a strife accurst
  Where Allen Forman is an easy first,
  And where the second prize is rightly flung
  To Charley Shortridge or to Mike de Young?

  In mental combat but a single end
  Inspires the formidable to contend.
  Not by the raw recruit's ambition fired,
  By whom foul blows, though harmless, are admired;
  Not by the coward's zeal, who, on his knee
  Behind the bole of his protecting tree,
  So curves his musket that the bark it fits,
  And, firing, blows the weapon into bits;
  But with the noble aim of one whose heart
  Values his foeman for he loves his art
  The veteran debater moves afield,
  Untaught to libel as untaught to yield.
  Dear foeman mine, I've but this end in view&mdash;
  That to prevent which most you wish to do.
  What, then, are you most eager to be at?
  To hate me? Nay, I'll help you, sir, at that.
  This only passion does your soul inspire:
  You wish to scorn me. Well, you shall admire.

  'Tis not enough my neighbors that you school
  In the belief that I'm a rogue or fool;
  That small advantage you would gladly trade
  For what one moment would <i>yourself</i> persuade.
  Write, then, your largest and your longest lie:
  <i>You</i> sha'n't believe it, howsoe'er you try.
  No falsehood you can tell, no evil do,
  Shall turn me from the truth to injure you.
  So all your war is barren of effect;
  I find my victory in your respect.
  What profit have you if the world you set
  Against me? For the world will soon forget
  It thought me this or that; but I'll retain
  A vivid picture of your moral stain,
  And cherish till my memory expire
  The sweet, soft consciousness that you're a liar
  Is it <i>your</i> triumph, then, to prove that you
  Will do the thing that I would scorn to do?
  God grant that I forever be exempt
  From such advantage as my foe's contempt.

EMANCIPATION</h2>

  Return&mdash;if ever they were truly past:
  From sinful creditors' unholy greed
  The church called Calvary at last is freed&mdash;
  So called for there the Savior's crucified,
  Roberts and Carmany on either side.

  The circling contribution-box no more
  Provokes the nod and simulated snore;
  No more the Lottery, no more the Fair,
  Lure the reluctant dollar from its lair,
  Nor Ladies' Lunches at a bit a bite
  Destroy the health yet spare the appetite,
  While thrifty sisters o'er the cauldron stoop
  To serve their God with zeal, their friends with soup,
  And all the brethren mendicate the earth
  With viewless placards: "We've been <i>so</i> from birth!"

  Sure of his wage, the pastor now can lend
  His whole attention to his latter end,
  Remarking with a martyr's prescient thrill
  The Hemp maturing on the cheerless Hill.
  The holy brethren, lifting pious palms,
  Pour out their gratitude in prayer and psalms,
  Chant <i>De Profundis</i>, meaning "out of debt,"
  And dance like mad&mdash;or would if they were let.

  Deeply disguised (a deacon newly dead
  Supplied the means) Jack Satan holds his head
  As high as any and as loudly sings
  His <i>jubilate</i> till each rafter rings.
  "Rejoice, ye ever faithful," bellows he,
  "The debt is lifted and the temple free!"
  Then says, aside, with gentle cachination:
  "I've got a mortgage on the congregation."

  Full twenty centuries I fell,
  And then alighted. "Here you dwell
  For aye," a Voice cried&mdash;"this is Hell!"

  A landscape lay about my feet,
  Where trees were green and flowers sweet.
  The climate was devoid of heat.

  The sun looked down with gentle beam
  Upon the bosom of the stream,
  Nor saw I any sign of steam.

  The waters by the sky were tinged,
  The hills with light and color fringed.
  Birds warbled on the wing unsinged.

  "Ah, no, this is not Hell," I cried;
  "The preachers ne'er so greatly lied.
  This is Earth's spirit glorified!

  "Good souls do not in Hades dwell,
  And, look, there's John P. Irish!" "Well,"

  Alas, how brief the time, how great the change!&mdash;
  Your dogs of war are ailing all of mange;

  To load, for you, the brambles with their fleece,

  Ben Truman, you're a genius and can write,
    Though one would not suspect it from your looks.
  You lack that certain spareness which is quite
    Distinctive of the persons who make books.
    You show the workmanship of Stanford's cooks
  About the region of the appetite,
  Where geniuses are singularly slight.
  Your friends the Chinamen are understood,
  Indeed, to speak of you as "belly good."

  Still, you can write&mdash;spell, too, I understand&mdash;
    Though how two such accomplishments can go,
  Like sentimental schoolgirls, hand in hand
    Is more than ever I can hope to know.
    To have one talent good enough to show
  Has always been sufficient to command
  The veneration of the brilliant band
  Of railroad scholars, who themselves, indeed,
  Although they cannot write, can mostly read.

  There's Towne and Fillmore, Goodman and Steve Gage,
    Ned Curtis of Napoleonic face,
  Who used to dash his name on glory's page
    "A.M." appended to denote his place
    Among the learned. Now the last faint trace
  Of Nap. is all obliterate with age,
  And Ned's degree less precious than his wage.
  He says: "I done it," with his every breath.
  "Thou canst not say I did it," says Macbeth.

  Good land! how I run on! I quite forgot
    Whom this was meant to be about; for when
  I think upon that odd, unearthly lot&mdash;
    Not quite Creedhaymonds, yet not wholly men&mdash;
    I'm dominated by my rebel pen
  That, like the stubborn bird from which 'twas got,
  Goes waddling forward if I will or not.
  To leave your comrades, Ben, I'm now content:
  I'll meet them later if I don't repent.

  You've writ a letter, I observe&mdash;nay, more,
    You've published it&mdash;to say how good you think
  The coolies, and invite them to come o'er
    In thicker quantity. Perhaps you drink
  No corporation's wine, but love its ink;
  Or when you signed away your soul and swore
  On railrogue battle-fields to shed your gore
  You mentally reserved the right to shed
  The raiment of your character instead.

  You're naked, anyhow: unragged you stand
    In frank and stark simplicity of shame.
  And here upon your flank, in letters grand,
    The iron has marked you with your owner's name.
    Needless, for none would steal and none reclaim.
    But "#eland $tanford" is a pretty brand,
  Wrought by an artist with a cunning hand

  "Let each man consider himself legatee."

  In due course of time that philanthropist died,

  The lawyers preferring to manage the same.

  The cases were tried in Department Thirteen,
  Judge Murphy presided, sedate and serene,
  But couldn't quite specify, legal and straight,
  The cursedest rascal in all of the State.

  And so he remarked to them, little and big&mdash;
  To claimants: "You skip!" and to lawyers: "You dig!"
  They tumbled, tumultuous, out of his court
  And left him victorious, holding the fort.

  'Twas then that he said: "It is plain to my mind

THE OAKLAND DOG</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  I lay one happy night in bed
  And dreamed that all the dogs were dead.
  They'd all been taken out and shot&mdash;
  Their bodies strewed each vacant lot.

  O'er all the earth, from Berkeley down
  To San Leandro's ancient town,
  And out in space as far as Niles&mdash;
  I saw their mortal parts in piles.

  One stack upreared its ridge so high
  Against the azure of the sky
  That some good soul, with pious views,
  Put up a steeple and sold pews.

  No wagging tail the scene relieved:
  I never in my life conceived
  (I swear it on the Decalogue!)
  Such penury of living dog.

  The barking and the howling stilled,
  The snarling with the snarler killed,
  All nature seemed to hold its breath:
  The silence was as deep as death.

  True, candidates were all in roar
  On every platform, as before;
  And villains, as before, felt free
  To finger the calliope.

  True, the Salvationist by night,
  And milkman in the early light,
  The lonely flutist and the mill
  Performed their functions with a will.

  True, church bells on a Sunday rang
  The sick man's curtain down&mdash;the bang
  Of trains, contesting for the track,
  Out of the shadow called him back.

  True, cocks, at all unheavenly hours,
  Crew with excruciating powers,
  Cats on the woodshed rang and roared,
  Fat citizens and fog-horns snored.

  But this was all too fine for ears
  Accustomed, through the awful years,
  To the nocturnal monologues
  And day debates of Oakland dogs.

  And so the world was silent. Now
  What else befell&mdash;to whom and how?
  <i>Imprimis</i>, then, there were no fleas,
  And days of worth brought nights of ease.

  Men walked about without the dread
  Of being torn to many a shred,
  Each fragment holding half a cruse
  Of hydrophobia's quickening juice.

  They had not to propitiate
  Some curst kioodle at each gate,
  But entered one another's grounds,
  Unscared, and were not fed to hounds.

  Women could drive and not a pup
  Would lift the horse's tendons up
  And let them go&mdash;to interject
  A certain musical effect.

  Even children's ponies went about,
  All grave and sober-paced, without
  A bulldog hanging to each nose&mdash;
  Proud of his fragrance, I suppose.

  Dog being dead, Man's lawless flame
  Burned out: he granted Woman's claim,
  Children's and those of country, art&mdash;
  all took lodgings in his heart.

  When memories of his former shame
  Crimsoned his cheeks with sudden flame
  He said; "I know my fault too well&mdash;
  They fawned upon me and I fell."

  Ah! 'twas a lovely world!&mdash;no more
  I met that indisposing bore,
  The unseraphic cynogogue&mdash;
  The man who's proud to love a dog.

  Thus in my dream the golden reign
  Of Reason filled the world again,
  And all mankind confessed her sway,
  From Walnut Creek to San Jose.

THE UNFALLEN BRAVE</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Not all in sorrow and in tears,
  To pay of gratitude's arrears
    The yearly sum&mdash;
  Not prompted, wholly by the pride
  Of those for whom their friends have died,
    To-day we come.

  Another aim we have in view
  Than for the buried boys in blue
    To drop a tear:
  Memorial Day revives the chin
  Of Barnes, and Salomon chimes in&mdash;
    That's why we're here.

  And when in after-ages they
  Shall pass, like mortal men, away,
    Their war-song sung,
  Then fame will tell the tale anew
  Of how intrepidly they drew
    The deadly tongue.

  Then cull white lilies for the graves
  Of Liberty's loquacious braves,
    And roses red.
  Those represent their livers, these
  The blood that in unmeasured seas
    They did not shed.

A CELEBRATED CASE</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Way down in the Boom Belt lived Mrs. Roselle;
  A person named Petrie, he lived there as well;
  But Mr. Roselle he resided away&mdash;
  Sing tooral iooral iooral iay.

  Once Mrs. Roselle in her room was alone:
  The flesh of her flesh and the bone of her bone
  Neglected the wife of his bosom to woo&mdash;
  Sing tooral iooral iooral ioo.

  Then Petrie, her lover, appeared at the door,
  Remarking: "My dear; I don't love you no more."
  "That's awfully rough," said the lady, "on me&mdash;
  Sing tooral iooral iooral iee."

  "Come in, Mr. Petrie," she added, "pray do:
  Although you don't love me no more, I love you.
  Sit down while I spray you with vitriol now&mdash;
  Sing tooral iooral iooral iow."

  Said Petrie: "That liquid I know won't agree
  With my beauty, and then you'll no longer love me;
  So spray and be "&mdash;O, what a word he did say!&mdash;
  Sing tooral iooral iooral iay.

  She deluged his head and continued to pour
  Till his bonny blue eyes, like his love, were no more.
  It was seldom he got such a hearty shampoo&mdash;
  Sing tooral iooral iooral ioo.

  Then Petrie he rose and said: "Mrs. Roselle,
  I have an engagement and bid you farewell."
  "You see," she began to explain&mdash;but not he!&mdash;
  Sing tooral, iooral, iooral iee.

  The Sheriff he came and he offered his arm,
  Saying, "Sorry I am for disturbin' you, marm,
  But business is business." Said she, "So they say&mdash;
  Sing tooral, iooral, iooral iay."

  The Judge on the bench he looked awfully stern;
  The District Attorney began to attorn;
  The witnesses lied and the lawyers&mdash;O my!&mdash;
  Sing tooral, iooral, iooral iyi.

  The chap that defended her said: "It's our claim
  That he loved us no longer and told us the same.
  What else than we did could we decently do?&mdash;
  Sing tooral, iooral, iooral ioo."

  The District Attorney, sarcastic, replied:
  "We loved you no longer&mdash;that can't be denied.
  Not having no eyes we may dote on you now&mdash;
  Sing tooral, iooral, iooral iow."

  The prisoner wept to entoken her fears;
  The sockets of Petrie were flooded with tears.
  O heaven-born Sympathy, bully for you!&mdash;
  Sing tooral, iooral, iooral ioo.

  Four jurors considered the prisoner mad,
  And four thought her victim uncommonly bad,
  And four that the acid was all in his eye&mdash;
  Sing rum tiddy iddity iddity hi.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
      Intended for Inscription on a Sword Presented to Colonel
      Cutting of the National Guard of California.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  I am for Cutting. I'm a blade
  Designed for use at dress parade.
  My gleaming length, when I display
  Peace rules the land with gentle sway;
  But when the war-dogs bare their teeth
  Go seek me in the modest sheath.
  I am for Cutting. Not for me
  The task of setting nations free.
  Let soulless blades take human life,
  My softer metal shuns the strife.
  The annual review is mine,
  When gorgeous shopmen sweat and shine,
  And Biddy, tip-toe on the pave,
  Adores the cobble-trotting brave.
  I am for Cutting. 'Tis not mine
  To hew amain the hostile line;
  Not mine all pitiless to spread
  The plain with tumuli of dead.
  My grander duty lies afar
  From haunts of the insane hussar,
  Where charging horse and struggling foot
  Are grimed alike with cannon-soot.
  When Loveliness and Valor meet
  Beneath the trees to dance, and eat,
  And sing, and much beside, behold
  My golden glories all unfold!
  There formidably are displayed
  The useful horrors of my blade
  In time of feast and dance and ballad,
  I am for cutting chicken salad.

<h2><a name="link2H_4_0050" id="link2H_4_0050"></a>
A VISION OF RESURRECTION</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  I had a dream. The habitable earth&mdash;
  Its continents and islands, all were bare
  Of cities and of forests. Naught remained
  Of its old aspect, and I only knew
  (As men know things in dreams, unknowing how)
  That this was earth and that all men were dead.
  On every side I saw the barren land,
  Even to the distant sky's inclosing blue,
  Thick-pitted all with graves; and all the graves
  Save one were open&mdash;not as newly dug,
  But rather as by some internal force
  Riven for egress. Tombs of stone were split
  And wide agape, and in their iron decay
  The massive mausoleums stood in halves.
  With mildewed linen all the ground was white.
  Discarded shrouds upon memorial stones
  Hung without motion in the soulless air.
  While greatly marveling how this should be
  I heard, or fancied that I heard, a voice,
  Low like an angel's, delicately strong,
  And sweet as music.

                      &mdash;"Spirit," it said, "behold
  The burial place of universal Man!
  A million years have rolled away since here
  His sheeted multitudes (save only some
  Whose dark misdeeds required a separate
  And individual arraignment) rose
  To judgment at the trumpet's summoning
  And passed into the sky for their award,
  Leaving behind these perishable things
  Which yet, preserved by miracle, endure
  Till all are up. Then they and all of earth,
  Rock-hearted mountain and storm-breasted sea,
  River and wilderness and sites of dead
  And vanished capitals of men, shall spring
  To flame, and naught shall be for evermore!
  When all are risen that wonder will occur.
  'Twas but ten centuries ago the last
  But one came forth&mdash;a soul so black with sin,
  Against whose name so many crimes were set
  That only now his trial is at end.
  But one remains."

  Straight, as the voice was stilled&mdash;
  That single rounded mound cracked lengthliwise
  And one came forth in grave-clothes. For a space
  He stood and gazed about him with a smile
  Superior; then laying off his shroud
  Disclosed his two attenuated legs
  Which, like parentheses, bent outwardly
  As by the weight of saintliness above,
  And so sprang upward and was lost to view
  Noting his headstone overthrown, I read:
  "Sacred to memory of George K. Fitch,
  Deacon and Editor&mdash;a holy man
  Who fell asleep in Jesus, full of years
  And blessedness. The dead in Christ rise first."

MASTER OF THREE ARTS</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Your various talents, Goldenson, command
    Respect: you are a poet and can draw.
  It is a pity that your gifted hand
    Should ever have been raised against the law.
  If you had drawn no pistol, but a picture,
  You would have saved your throttle from a stricture.

  About your poetry I'm not so sure:
    'Tis certain we have much that's quite as bad,
  Whose hardy writers have not to endure
    The hangman's fondling. It is said they're mad:
  Though lately Mr. Brooks (I mean the poet)
  Looked well, and if demented didn't show it.

  Well, Goldenson, I am a poet, too&mdash;
    Taught by the muses how to smite the harp
  And lift the tuneful voice, although, like you
    And Brooks, I sometimes flat and sometimes sharp.
  But let me say, with no desire to taunt you,
  I never murder even the girls I want to.

  I hold it one of the poetic laws
    To sing of life, not take. I've ever shown
  A high regard for human life because
    I have such trouble to support my own.
  And you&mdash;well, you'll find trouble soon in blowing
  Your private coal to keep it red and glowing.

  I fancy now I see you at the Gate
    Approach St. Peter, crawling on your belly,
  You cry: "Good sir, take pity on my state&mdash;
    Forgive the murderer of Mamie Kelly!"
  And Peter says: "O, that's all right&mdash;but, mister,
  You scribbled rhymes. In Hell I'll make you
       blister!"

A SOCIETY LEADER</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "The Social World"! O what a world it is&mdash;
    Where full-grown men cut capers in the German,
  Cotillion, waltz, or what you will, and whizz
    And spin and hop and sprawl about like mermen!
    I wonder if our future Grant or Sherman,
  As these youths pass their time, is passing his&mdash;
    If eagles ever come from painted eggs,
    Or deeds of arms succeed to deeds of legs.

  I know they tell us about Waterloo:
    How, "foremost fighting," fell the evening's
      dancers.
  I don't believe it: I regard it true
    That soldiers who are skillful in "the Lancers"
    Less often die of cannon than of cancers.
  Moreover, I am half-persuaded, too,
    That David when he danced before the Ark
    Had the reporter's word to keep it dark.

  Ed. Greenway, you fatigue. Your hateful name
    Like maiden's curls, is in the papers daily.
  You think it, doubtless, honorable fame,
    And contemplate the cheap distinction gaily,
    As does the monkey the blue-painted tail he
  Believes becoming to him. 'Tis the same
    With men as other monkeys: all their souls
    Crave eminence on any kind of poles.
  But cynics (barking tribe!) are all agreed
    That monkeys upon poles performing capers
  Are not exalted, they are only "treed."
    A glory that is kindled by the papers
    Is transient as the phosphorescent vapors
  That shine in graveyards and are seen, indeed,
    But while the bodies that supply the gas
    Are turning into weeds to feed an ass.

  One can but wonder sometimes how it feels
    To <i>be</i> an ass&mdash;a beast we beat condignly
  Because, like yours, his life is in his heels
    And he is prone to use them unbenignly.
    The ladies (bless them!) say you dance divinely.
  I like St. Vitus better, though, who deals
    His feet about him with a grace more just,
    And hops, not for he will, but for he must.

  Doubtless it gratifies you to observe
    Elbowy girls and adipose mamas
  All looking adoration as you swerve
    This way and that; but prosperous papas
    Laugh in their sleeves at you, and their ha-has,
  If heard, would somewhat agitate your nerve.
    And dames and maids who keep you on their
      shelves
  Don't seem to want a closer tie themselves.

  Gods! what a life you live!&mdash;by day a slave
    To your exacting back and urgent belly;
  Intent to earn and vigilant to save&mdash;
    By night, attired so sightly and so smelly,
    With countenance as luminous as jelly,
  Bobbing and bowing! King of hearts and knave
    Of diamonds, I'd bet a silver brick
    If brains were trumps you'd never take a trick.

    Heard voices, and approaching whence they came,
  Listened indifferently where a key

  Said to her daughter: "Go to yonder caddy
  And get some emery to scour your daddy."

  And then I knew&mdash;some intuition said&mdash;
    That tombs were not and men had cleared their shelves
  Of urns; and the electro-plated dead
    Stood pedestaled as statues of themselves.
  With famous dead men all the public places
  Were thronged, and some in piles awaited bases.

  One mighty structure's high fagade alone
  Contained a single monumental niche,
  Where, central in that steep expanse of stone,
  Gleamed the familiar form of Thomas Fitch.

  Attorney Knight, it happens so sometimes
  That lawyers, justifying cut-throats' crimes
  For hire&mdash;calumniating, too, for gold,
  The dead, dumb victims cruelly unsouled&mdash;
  Speak, through the press, to a tribunal far
  More honorable than their Honors are,&mdash;
  A court that sits not with assenting smile
  While living rogues dead gentleman revile,&mdash;
  A court where scoundrel ethics of your trade
  Confuse no judgment and no cheating aid,&mdash;
  The Court of Honest Souls, where you in vain
  May plead your right to falsify for gain,
  Sternly reminded if a man engage
  To serve assassins for the liar's wage,
  His mouth with vilifying falsehoods crammed,
  He's twice detestable and doubly damned!

  Attorney Knight, defending Powell, you,
  To earn your fee, so energetic grew
  (So like a hound, the pride of all the pack,
  Clapping your nose upon the dead man's track
  To run his faults to earth&mdash;at least proclaim
  At vacant holes the overtaken game)
  That men who marked you nourishing the tongue,
  And saw your arms so vigorously swung,
  All marveled how so light a breeze could stir
  So great a windmill to so great a whirr!
  Little they knew, or surely they had grinned,
  The mill was laboring to raise the wind.

  Ralph Smith a "shoulder-striker"! God, O hear
  This hardy man's description of thy dear
  Dead child, the gentlest soul, save only One,
  E'er born in any land beneath the sun.
  All silent benefactions still he wrought:
  High deed and gracious speech and noble thought,
  Kept all thy law, and, seeking still the right,
  Upon his blameless breast received the light.

  "Avenge, O Lord, thy slaughtered saints," he cried
  Whose wrath was deep as his comparison wide&mdash;
  Milton, thy servant. Nay, thy will be done:
  To smite or spare&mdash;to me it all is one.
  Can vengeance bring my sorrow to an end,
  Or justice give me back my buried friend?
  But if some Milton vainly now implore,
  And Powell prosper as he did before,
  Yet 'twere too much that, making no ado,
  Thy saints be slaughtered and be slandered too.
  So, Lord, make Knight his weapon keep in sheath,
  Or do Thou wrest it from between his teeth!

UNARMED</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Saint Peter sat at the jasper gate,
  When Stephen M. White arrived in state.

  "Admit me." "With pleasure," Peter said,
  Pleased to observe that the man was dead;

  "That's what I'm here for. Kindly show
  Your ticket, my lord, and in you go."

  White stared in blank surprise. Said he
  "I <i>run</i> this place&mdash;just turn that key."

  "Yes?" said the Saint; and Stephen heard
  With pain the inflection of that word.

  But, mastering his emotion, he
  Remarked: "My friend, you're too d&mdash;&mdash; free;

  "I'm Stephen M., by thunder, White!"
  And, "Yes?" the guardian said, with quite

  The self-same irritating stress
  Distinguishing his former yes.

  And still demurely as a mouse
  He twirled the key to that Upper House.

  Then Stephen, seeing his bluster vain
  Admittance to those halls to gain,

  Said, neighborly: "Pray tell me. Pete,
  Does any one contest my seat?"

  The Saint replied: "Nay, nay, not so;
  But you voted always wrong below:

  "Whate'er the question, clear and high
  You're voice rang: '<i>I</i>,' '<i>I</i>,' ever '<i>I</i>.'"

  Now indignation fired the heart
  Of that insulted immortal part.

  "Die, wretch!" he cried, with blanching lip,
  And made a motion to his hip,

  With purpose murderous and hearty,
  To draw the Democratic party!

  He felt his fingers vainly slide
  Upon his unappareled hide

  (The dead arise from their "silent tents"
  But not their late habiliments)

  You recently have said, I hear,

  To serve as Senator. That's queer!
    Have you told William Stow?

  Once when the Legislature said:
    "Go, Stanford, and be great!"
  You lifted up your Jovian head
    And everlooked the State.

  As one made leisurely awake,
    You lightly rubbed your eyes
  And answered: "Thank you&mdash;please to make
    A note of my surprise.

  "But who are they who skulk aside,
    As to get out of reach,
  And in their clothing strive to hide
    Three thousand dollars each?

  "Not members of your body, sure?
    No, that can hardly be:
  All statesmen, I suppose, are pure.
    What! there are rogues? Dear me!"

  You added, you'll recall, that though
    You were surprised and pained,
  You thought, upon the whole, you'd go,
    And in that mind remained.

  Now, what so great a change has wrought
    That you so frankly speak
  Of "seeking" honors once unsought
    Because you "scorned to seek"?

  Do you not fear the grave reproof
    In good Creed Haymond's eye?
  Will Stephen Gage not stand aloof
    And pass you coldly by?

  O, fear you not that Vrooman's lich
    Will rise from earth and point
  At you a scornful finger which
    May lack, perchance, a joint?

  Go, Stanford, where the violets grow,
    And join their modest train.
  Await the work of William Stow
    And be surprised again.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Welcome, good friend; as you have served your term,
    And found the joy of crime to be a fiction,
  I hope you'll hold your present faith, stand firm
    And not again be open to conviction.

  Your sins, though scarlet once, are now as wool:
    You've made atonement for all past offenses,
  And conjugated&mdash;'twas an awful pull!&mdash;
    The verb "to pay" in all its moods and tenses.

  You were a dreadful criminal&mdash;by Heaven,
    I think there never was a man so sinful!
  We've all a pinch or two of Satan's leaven,
    But you appeared to have an even skinful.

  Earth shuddered with aversion at your name;
    Rivers fled backward, gravitation scorning;
  The sea and sky, from thinking on your shame,
    Grew lobster-red at eve and in the morning.

  But still red-handed at your horrid trade
    You wrought, to reason deaf, and to compassion.
  But now with gods and men your peace is made
    I beg you to be good and in the fashion.

  What's that?&mdash;you "ne'er again will rob a stage"?
    What! did you do so? Faith, I didn't know it.
  Was <i>that</i> what threw poor Themis in a rage?
    I thought you were convicted as a poet!

  I own it was a comfort to my soul,
    And soothed it better than the deepest curses,
  To think they'd got one poet in a hole
    Where, though he wrote, he could not print, his verses.

  I thought that Welcker, Plunkett, Brooks, and all
    The ghastly crew who always are begriming
  With villain couplets every page and wall,
    Might be arrested and "run in" for rhyming.

  And then Parnassus would be left to me,
    And Pegasus should bear me up it gaily,
  Nor down a steep place run into the sea,
    As now he must be tempted to do daily.

  Well, grab the lyre-strings, hearties, and begin:
    Bawl your harsh souls all out upon the gravel.
  I must endure you, for you'll never sin
    By robbing coaches, until dead men travel.

A "SCION OF NOBILITY"</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Come, sisters, weep!&mdash;our Baron dear,
    Alas! has run away.
  If always we had kept him here
    He had not gone astray.

  Painter and grainer it were vain
    To say he was, before;
  And if he were, yet ne'er again
    He'll darken here a door.

  We mourn each matrimonial plan&mdash;
    Even tradesmen join the cry:
  He was so promising a man
    Whenever he did buy.

  He was a fascinating lad,
    Deny it all who may;
  Even moneyed men confess he had
    A very taking way.

  So from our tables he is gone&mdash;
    Our tears descend in showers;
  We loved the very fat upon.
    His kidneys, for 'twas ours.

  To women he was all respect
    To duns as cold as ice;
  No lady could his suit reject,
    No tailor get its price.

  He raised our hope above the sky;
    Alas! alack! and O!
  That one who worked it up so high
    Should play it down so low!

THE CONVICTS' BALL</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  San Quentin was brilliant. Within the halls
  Of the noble pile with the frowning walls
  (God knows they've enough to make them frown,
  With a Governor trying to break them down!)
  Was a blaze of light. 'Twas the natal day
  Of his nibs the popular John S. Gray,
  And many observers considered his birth
  The primary cause of his moral worth.
  "The ball is free!" cried Black Bart, and they all
  Said a ball with no chain was a novel ball;
  "And I never have seed," said Jimmy Hope,
  "Sech a lightsome dance withouten a rope."
  Chinamen, Indians, Portuguese, Blacks,
  Russians, Italians, Kanucks and Kanaks,
  Chilenos, Peruvians, Mexicans&mdash;all
  Greased with their presence that notable ball.
  None were excluded excepting, perhaps,
  The Rev. Morrison's churchly chaps,
  Whom, to prevent a religious debate,
  The Warden had banished outside of the gate.
  The fiddler, fiddling his hardest the while,
  "Called off" in the regular foot-hill style:
  "Circle to the left!" and "Forward and back!"
  And "Hellum to port for the stabbard tack!"
  (This great <i>virtuoso</i>, it would appear,
  Was Mate of the <i>Gatherer</i> many a year.)
  "<i>Ally man</i> left!"&mdash;to a painful degree
  His French was unlike to the French of Paree,
  As heard from our countrymen lately abroad,
  And his "<i>doe cee doe</i>" was the gem of the fraud.
  But what can you hope from a gentleman barred
  From circles of culture by dogs in the yard?
  'Twas a glorious dance, though, all the same,
  The Jardin Mabille in the days of its fame
  Never saw legs perform such springs&mdash;
  The cold-chisel's magic had given them wings.
  They footed it featly, those lades and gents:
  Dull care (said Long Moll) had a helly go-hence!

  'Twas a very aristocratic affair:
  The <i>crjme de la crjme</i> and <i>ilite</i> were there&mdash;
  Rank, beauty and wealth from the highest sets,
  And Hubert Howe Bancroft sent his regrets.

A MERCIFUL GOVERNOR</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Standing within the triple wall of Hell,
    And flattening his nose against a grate
  Behind whose brazen bars he'd had to dwell
    A thousand million ages to that date,
    Stoneman bewailed his melancholy fate,
  And his big tear-drops, boiling as they fell,
  Had worn between his feet, the record mentions,
  A deep depression in the "good intentions."

  Imperfectly by memory taught how&mdash;
    For prayer in Hell is a lost art&mdash;he prayed,
  Uplifting his incinerated brow
    And flaming hands in supplication's aid.
  "O grant," he cried, "my torment may be stayed&mdash;
  In mercy, some short breathing spell allow!
  If one good deed I did before my ghosting,
  Spare me and give Delmas a double roasting."

  Breathing a holy harmony in Hell,
    Down through the appalling clamors of the place,
  Charming them all to willing concord, fell
    A Voice ineffable and full of grace:
  "Because of all the law-defying race
  One single malefactor of the cell
  Thou didst not free from his incarceration,
  Take thou ten thousand years of condonation."

  Back from their fastenings began to shoot
    The rusted bolts; with dreadful roar, the gate
  Laboriously turned; and, black with soot,
    The extinguished spirit passed that awful strait,
    And as he legged it into space, elate,
  Muttered: "Yes, I remember that galoot&mdash;
  I'd signed his pardon, ready to allot it,
  But stuck it in my desk and quite forgot it."

A SOARING TOAD</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  So, Governor, you would not serve again
    Although we'd all agree to pay you double.
  You find it all is vanity and pain&mdash;
    One clump of clover in a field of stubble&mdash;
    One grain of pleasure in a peck of trouble.
  'Tis sad, at your age, having to complain
  Of disillusion; but the fault is whose
  When pigmies stumble, wearing giants' shoes?

  I humbly told you many moons ago
    For high preferment you were all unfit.
  A clumsy bear makes but a sorry show
    Climbing a pole. Let him, judicious, sit
    With dignity at bottom of his pit,
  And none his awkwardness will ever know.
  Some beasts look better, and feel better, too,
  Seen from above; and so, I think, would you.

  Why, you were mad! Did you suppose because
    Our foolish system suffers foolish men
  To climb to power, make, enforce the laws,
    And, it is whispered, break them now and then,
    We love the fellows and respect them when
  We've stilled the volume of our loud hurrahs?
  When folly blooms we trample it the more
  For having fertilized it heretofore.

  Behold yon laborer! His garb is mean,
    His face is grimy, but who thinks to ask
  The measure of his brains? 'Tis only seen
    He's fitted for his honorable task,
    And so delights the mind. But let him bask
  In droll prosperity, absurdly clean&mdash;
  Is that the man whom we admired before?
  Good Lord, how ignorant, and what a bore!

  Better for you that thoughtless men had said
    (Noting your fitness in the humbler sphere):
  "Why don't they make him Governor?" instead
    Of, "Why the devil did they?" But I fear
    My words on your inhospitable ear
  Are wasted like a sermon to the dead.
  Still, they may profit you if studied well:
  You can't be taught to think, but may to spell.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Sweet Auburn! liveliest village of the plain,
  Where Health and Slander welcome every train,
  Whence smiling innocence, its tribute paid,
  Retires in terror, wounded and dismayed&mdash;
  Dear lovely bowers of gossip and disease,
  Whose climate cures us that thy dames may tease,
  How often have I knelt upon thy green
  And prayed for death, to mitigate their spleen!
  How often have I paused on every charm
  With mingled admiration and alarm&mdash;
  The brook that runs by many a scandal-mill,
  The church whose pastor groans upon the grill,
  The cowthorn bush with seats beneath the shade,
  Where hearts are struck and reputations flayed;
  How often wished thine idle wives, some day,
  Might more at whist, less at the devil, play.

  Unblest retirement! ere my life's decline
  (Killed by detraction) may I witness thine.
  How happy she who, shunning shades like these,
  Finds in a wolf-den greater peace and ease;
  Who quits the place whence truth did earlier fly,
  And rather than come back prefers to die!
  For her no jealous maids renounce their sleep,
  Contriving malices to make her weep;
  No iron-faced dames her character debate
  And spurn imploring mercy from the gate;
  But down she lies to a more peaceful end,
  For wolves do not calumniate, but rend&mdash;
  Sinks piecemeal to their maws, a willing prey,
  While resignation lubricates the way,
  And all her prospects brighten at the last:
  To wolves, not women, an approved repast.

  The seller "threw you in." That goes for naught&mdash;
  Man takes delight in fancy's fine inventions,

    Wild sweep of the great billow you had got
    Atop of, like a swimmer bold? Great Scott!
  How fine your wavemanship! How loud your song
  Of "Down with railroads!" When the wave subsided
  And left you stranded you were much divided.

  You got your serviceable basin ready.

  Ah, welcome, welcome! Sit you down, old friend;
  Your pipe I'll serve, your bottle I'll attend.
  'Tis many a year since you and I have known
  Society more pleasant than our own
  In our brief respites from excessive work&mdash;
  I pointing out the hearts for you to dirk.
  What have you done since lately at this board
  We canvassed the deserts of all the horde
  And chose what names would please the people best,
  Engraved on coffin-plates&mdash;what bounding breast
  Would give more satisfaction if at rest?
  But never mind&mdash;the record cannot fail:
  The loftiest monuments will tell the tale.

  I trust ere next we meet you'll slay the chap
  Who calls old Tyler "Judge" and Merry "Cap"&mdash;
  Calls John P. Irish "Colonel" and John P.,
  Whose surname Jack-son speaks his pedigree,
  By the same title&mdash;men of equal rank
  Though one is belly all, and one all shank,
  Showing their several service in the fray:
  One fought for food and one to get away.
  I hope, I say, you'll kill the "title" man
  Who saddles one on every back he can,
  Then rides it from Bekrsheba to Dan!
  Another fool, I trust, you will perform
  Your office on while my resentment's warm:
  He shakes my hand a dozen times a day
  If, luckless, I so often cross his way,
  Though I've three senses besides that of touch,
  To make me conscious of a fool too much.
  Seek him, friend Killer, and your purpose make
  Apparent as his guilty hand you take,
  And set him trembling with a solemn: "Shake!"

  But chief of all the addle-witted crew
  Conceded by the Hangman's League to you,
  The fool (his dam's acquainted with a knave)
  Whose fluent pen, of his no-brain the slave,
  Strews notes of introduction o'er the land
  And calls it hospitality&mdash;his hand
  May palsy seize ere he again consign
  To me his friend, as I to Hades mine!
  Pity the wretch, his faults howe'er you see,
  Whom A accredits to his victim, B.
  Like shuttlecock which battledores attack
  (One speeds it forward, one would drive it back)
  The trustful simpleton is twice unblest&mdash;
  A rare good riddance, an unwelcome guest.
  The glad consignor rubs his hands to think
  How duty is commuted into ink;
  The consignee (his hands he cannot rub&mdash;
  He has the man upon them) mutters: "Cub!"
  And straightway plans to lose him at the Club.
  You know, good Killer, where this dunce abides&mdash;
  The secret jungle where he writes and hides&mdash;
  Though no exploring foot has e'er upstirred
  His human elephant's exhaustless herd.
  Go, bring his blood! We'll drink it&mdash;letting fall
  A due libation to the gods of Gall.
  On second thought, the gods may have it all.

THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  I should like, good friends, to mention the disaster which befell
  Mr. William Perry Peters, of the town of Muscatel,
  Whose fate is full of meaning, if correctly understood&mdash;
  Admonition to the haughty, consolation to the good.

  It happened in the hot snap which we recently incurred,
  When 'twas warm enough to carbonize the feathers of a bird,
  And men exclaimed: "By Hunky!" who were bad enough to swear,
  And pious persons supervised their adjectives with care.

  Mr. Peters was a pedagogue of honor and repute,
  His learning comprehensive, multifarious, minute.
  It was commonly conceded in the section whence he came
  That the man who played against him needed knowledge of the game.

  And some there were who whispered, in the town of Muscatel,
  That besides the game of Draw he knew Orthography as well;
  Though, the school directors, frigidly contemning that as stuff,
  Thought that Draw (and maybe Spelling, if it pleased him) was enough.

  Withal, he was a haughty man&mdash;indubitably great,
  But too vain of his attainments and his power in debate.
  His mien was contumelious to men of lesser gift:
  "It's only <i>me</i>," he said, "can give the human mind a lift.

  "Before a proper audience, if ever I've a chance,
  You'll see me chipping in, the cause of Learning to advance.
  Just let me have a decent chance to back my mental hand
  And I'll come to center lightly in a way they'll understand."

  Such was William Perry Peters, and I feel a poignant sense
  Of grief that I'm unable to employ the present tense;
  But Providence disposes, be our scheming what it may,
  And disposed of Mr. Peters in a cold, regardless way.

  It occurred in San Francisco, whither Mr. Peters came
  In the cause of Education, feeling still the holy flame
  Of ambition to assist in lifting up the human mind
  To a higher plane of knowledge than its Architect designed.

  He attended the convention of the pedagogic host;
  He was first in the Pavilion, he was last to leave his post.
  For days and days he narrowly observed the Chairman's eye,
  His efforts ineffectual to catch it on the fly.

  The blessed moment came at last: the Chairman tipped his head.
  "The gentleman from ah&mdash;um&mdash;er," that functionary said.
  The gentleman from ah&mdash;um&mdash;er reflected with a grin:
  "They'll know me better by-and-by, when I'm a-chipping in."

  So William Perry Peters mounted cheerfully his feet&mdash;
  And straightway was aglow with an incalculable heat!
  His face was as effulgent as a human face could be,
  And caloric emanated from his whole periphery;

  For he felt himself the focus of non-Muscatelish eyes,
  And the pain of their convergence was a terror and surprise.
  As with pitiless impaction all their heat-waves on him broke
  He was seen to be evolving awful quantities of smoke!

  "Put him out!" cried all in chorus; but the meaning wasn't clear
  Of that succoring suggestion to his obfuscated ear;
  And it notably augmented his incinerating glow
  To regard himself excessive, or in any way <i>de trop</i>.

  Gone was all his wild ambition to lift up the human mind!&mdash;
  Gone the words he would have uttered!&mdash;gone the thought that lay behind!
  For "words that burn" may be consumed in a superior flame,
  And "thoughts that breathe" may breathe their last, and die a death of shame.

  He'd known himself a shining light, but never had he known
  Himself so very luminous as now he knew he shone.
  "A pillar, I, of fire," he'd said, "to guide my race will be;"
  And now that very inconvenient thing to him was he.

  He stood there all irresolute; the seconds went and came;
  The minutes passed and did but add fresh fuel to his flame.
  How long he stood he knew not&mdash;'twas a century or more&mdash;
  And then that incandescent man levanted for the door!

  He darted like a comet from the building to the street,
  Where Fahrenheit attested ninety-five degrees of heat.
  Vicissitudes of climate make the tenure of the breath
  Precarious, and William Perry Peters froze to death!

A POLITICAL APOSTATE</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Good friend, it is with deep regret I note
  The latest, strangest turning of your coat;
  Though any way you wear that mental clout
  The seamy side seems always to be out.
  Who could have thought that you would e'er sustain
  The Southern shotgun's arbitrary reign!&mdash;
  Your sturdy hand assisting to replace
  The broken yoke on a delivered race;
  The ballot's purity no more your care,
  With equal privilege to dark and fair.
  To Yesterday a traitor, to To-day
  You're constant but the better to betray
  To-morrow. Your convictions all are naught
  But the wild asses of the world of thought,
  Which, flying mindless o'er the barren plain,
  Perceive at last they've nothing so to gain,
  And, turning penitent upon their track,
  Economize their strength by flying back.

  Ex-champion of Freedom, battle-lunged,
  No more, red-handed, or at least red-tongued,
  Brandish the javelin which by others thrown
  Clove Sambo's heart to quiver in your own!
  Confess no more that when his blood was shed,
  And you so sympathetically bled,
  The bow that spanned the mutual cascade
  Was but the promise of a roaring trade
  In offices. Your fingering now the trigger
  Shows that you <i>knew</i> your Negro was a nigger!
  <i>Ad hominem</i> this <i>argumentum</i> runs:
  Peace!&mdash;let us fire another kind of guns.

  I grant you, friend, that it is very true
  The Blacks are ignorant&mdash;and sable, too.
  What then? One way of two a fool must vote,
  And either way with gentlemen of note
  Whose villain feuds the fact attest too well
  That pedagogues nor vice nor error quell.
  The fiercest controversies ever rage
  When Miltons and Salmasii engage.
  No project wide attention ever drew
  But it disparted all the learned crew.
  As through their group the cleaving line's prolonged
  With fiery combatants each field is thronged.
  In battle-royal they engage at once
  For guidance of the hesitating dunce.
  The Titans on the heights contend full soon&mdash;
  On this side Webster and on that Calhoun,
  The monstrous conflagration of their fight
  Startling the day and splendoring the night!
  Both are unconquerable&mdash;<i>one</i> is right.
  Will't keep the pigmy, if we make him strong,
  From siding with a giant in the wrong?
  When Genius strikes for error, who's afraid
  To arm poor Folly with a wooden blade?
  O Rabelais, you knew it all!&mdash;your good
  And honest judge (by men misunderstood)
  Knew to be right there was but one device
  Less fallible than ignorance&mdash;the dice.
  The time must come&mdash;Heaven expedite the day!&mdash;
  When all mankind shall their decrees obey,
  And nations prosper in their peaceful sway.

A WORD TO THE UNWISE</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
      [Charles Main, of the firm of Main &amp; Winchester, has ordered a
      grand mausoleum for his plot in Mountain View Cemetery.&mdash;<i>City
      Newspaper</i>.]
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Charles Main, of Main &amp; Winchester, attend
  With friendly ear the chit-chat of a friend
    Who knows you not, yet knows that you and he
  Travel two roads that have a common end.

  We journey forward through the time allowed,
  I humbly bending, you erect and proud.
    Our heads alike will stable soon the worm&mdash;
  The one that's lifted, and the one that's bowed.

  You in your mausoleum shall repose,
  I where it pleases Him who sleep bestows;
    What matter whether one so little worth
  Shall stain the marble or shall feed the rose?

  Charles Main, I had a friend who died one day.
  A metal casket held his honored clay.
    Of cyclopean architecture stood
  The splendid vault where he was laid away.

  A dozen years, and lo! the roots of grass
  Had burst asunder all the joints; the brass,
    The gilded ornaments, the carven stones
  Lay tumbled all together in a mass.

  A dozen years! That taxes your belief.
  Make it a thousand if the time's too brief.
    'Twill be the same to you; when you are dead
  You cannot even count your days of grief.

  Suppose a pompous monument you raise
  Till on its peak the solar splendor blaze
    While yet about its base the night is black;
  But will it give your glory length of days?

  Say, when beneath your rubbish has been thrown,
  Some rogue to reputation all unknown&mdash;
    Men's backs being turned&mdash;should lift his thieving hand,
  Efface your name and substitute his own.

  Whose then would be the monument? To whom
  Would be the fame? Forgotten in your gloom,
    Your very name forgotten&mdash;ah, my friend,
  The name is all that's rescued by the tomb.

  For memory of worth and work we go
  To other records than a stone can show.
    These lacking, naught remains; with these
  The stone is needless for the world will know.

  Then build your mausoleum if you must,
  And creep into it with a perfect trust;
    But in the twinkling of an eye the plow
  Shall pass without obstruction through your dust.

  Another movement of the pendulum,
  And, lo! the desert-haunting wolf shall come,
    And, seated on the spot, shall howl by night
  O'er rotting cities, desolate and dumb.

ON THE PLATFORM</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  When Dr. Bill Bartlett stepped out of the hum
    Of Mammon's distracting and wearisome strife
  To stand and deliver a lecture on "Some
    Conditions of Intellectual Life,"
  I cursed the offender who gave him the hall
  To lecture on any conditions at all!

  But he rose with a fire divine in his eye,
    Haranguing with endless abundance of breath,
  Till I slept; and I dreamed of a gibbet reared high,
    And Dr. Bill Bartlett was dressing for death.
  And I thought in my dream: "These conditions, no doubt,
  Are bad for the life he was talking about."

  So I cried (pray remember this all was a dream):
    "Get off of the platform!&mdash;it isn't the kind!"
  But he fell through the trap, with a jerk at the beam,
    And wiggled his toes to unburden his mind.
  And, O, so bewitching the thoughts he advanced,
  That I clung to his ankles, attentive, entranced!

  Then rose an aged preacher man
    Whom all did much admire,
  Who said: "To force on you my plan

  But streams, it seems, might quench these beams
    If turned upon the fire."

  The fireman said: "This hoary wight

TO A WORD-WARRIOR</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Frank Pixley, you, who kiss the hand
    That strove to cut the country's throat,
    Cannot forgive the hands that smote
  Applauding in a distant land,&mdash;

  Applauding carelessly, as one
    The weaker willing to befriend
    Until the quarrel's at an end,
  Then learn by whom it was begun.

  When North was pitted against South
    Non-combatants on either side
    In calculating fury vied,
  And fought their foes by word of mouth.

  That devil's-camisade you led
    With formidable feats of tongue.
    Upon the battle's rear you hung&mdash;
  With Samson's weapon slew the dead!

  So hot the ardor of your soul
    That every fierce civilian came,
    His torch to kindle at your name,
  Or have you blow his cooling coal.

  Men prematurely left their beds
    And sought the gelid bath&mdash;so great
    The heat and splendor of your hate
  Of Englishmen and "Copperheads."

  King Liar of deceitful men,
    For imposition doubly armed!
    The patriots whom your speaking charmed
  You stung to madness with your pen.

  There was a certain journal here,
    Its English owner growing rich&mdash;
    Your hand the treason wrote for which
  A mob cut short its curst career.

  If, Pixley, you had not the brain
    To know the true from false, or you
    To Truth had courage to be true,
  And loyal to her perfect reign;

  If you had not your powers arrayed
    To serve the wrong by tricksy speech,
    Nor pushed yourself within the reach
  Of retribution's accolade,

  I had not had the will to go
    Outside the olive-bordered path
    Of peace to cut the birch of wrath,
  And strip your body for the blow.

  Behold how dark the war-clouds rise
    About the mother of our race!
    The lightnings gild her tranquil face
  And glitter in her patient eyes.

  Her children throng the hither flood
    And lean intent above the beach.
    Their beating hearts inhibit speech
  With stifling tides of English blood.

  "Their skies, but not their hearts, they change
    Who go in ships across the sea"&mdash;
    Through all centuries to be
  The strange new land will still be strange.

  The Island Mother holds in gage
    The souls of sons she never saw;
    Superior to law, the law
  Of sympathetic heritage.

  Forgotten now the foolish reign
    Of wrath which sundered trivial ties.
    A soldier's sabre vainly tries
  To cleave a spiritual chain.

  The iron in our blood affines,
    Though fratricidal hands may spill.
    Shall Hate be throned on Bunker Hill,
  Yet Love abide at Seven Pines?

THE OLEOMARGARINE MAN</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Once&mdash;in the county of Marin,
  Where milk is sold to purchase gin&mdash;
  Renowned for butter and renowned
  For fourteen ounces to the pound&mdash;
  A bull stood watching every turn
  Of Mr. Wilson with a churn,
  As that deigning worthy stalked
  About him, eying as he walked,
  El Toro's sleek and silken hide,
  His neck, his flank and all beside;
  Thinking with secret joy: "I'll spread
  That mammal on a slice of bread!"

  Soon Mr. Wilson's keen concern
  To get the creature in his churn
  Unhorsed his caution&mdash;made him blind
  To the fell vigor of bullkind,
  Till, filled with valor to the teeth,
  He drew his dasher from its sheath
  And bravely brandished it; the while
  He smiled a dark, portentous smile;
  A deep, sepulchral smile; a wide
  And open smile, which, at his side,
  The churn to copy vainly tried;
  A smile so like the dawn of doom
  That all the field was palled in gloom,
  And all the trees within a mile,
  As tribute to that awful smile,
  Made haste, with loyalty discreet,
  To fling their shadows at his feet.
  Then rose his battle-cry: "I'll spread
  That mammal on a slice of bread!"

  To such a night the day had turned
  That Taurus dimly was discerned.
  He wore so meek and grave an air
  It seemed as if, engaged in prayer
  This thunderbolt incarnate had
  No thought of anything that's bad:
  This concentrated earthquake stood
  And gave his mind to being good.
  Lightly and low he drew his breath&mdash;
  This magazine of sudden death!
  All this the thrifty Wilson's glance
  Took in, and, crying, "Now's my chance!"
  Upon the bull he sprang amain
  To put him in his churn. Again
  Rang out his battle-yell: "I'll spread
  That mammal on a slice of bread!"

  Sing, Muse, that battle-royal&mdash;sing
  The deeds that made the region ring,
  The blows, the bellowing, the cries,
  The dust that darkened all the skies,
  The thunders of the contest, all&mdash;
  Nay, none of these things did befall.
  A yell there was&mdash;a rush&mdash;no more:
  El Toro, tranquil as before,
  Still stood there basking in the sun,
  Nor of his legs had shifted one&mdash;
  Stood there and conjured up his cud
  And meekly munched it. Scenes of blood
  Had little charm for him. His head
  He merely nodded as he said:
  "I've spread that butterman upon
  A slice of Southern Oregon."

  Illustrious son of an illustrious sire&mdash;

  JUDGE RUTLEDGE

  Sultan of Stupids! with enough of brains
  To go indoors in all uncommon rains,
  But not enough to stay there when the storm
  Is past. When all the world is dry and warm,
  In irking comfort, lamentably gay,
  Keeping the evil tenor of your way,
  You walk abroad, sweet, beautiful and smug,
  And Justice hears you with her wonted shrug,
  Lifts her broad bandage half-an-inch and keeps
  One eye upon you while the other weeps.

  W.H.L. BARNES

  Happy the man who sin's proverbial wage
  Receives on the instalment plan&mdash;in age.
  For him the bulldog pistol's honest bark
  Has naught of terror in its blunt remark.
  He looks with calmness on the gleaming steel&mdash;
  If e'er it touched his heart he did not feel:
  Superior hardness turned its point away,
  Though urged by fond affinity to stay;
  His bloodless veins ignored the futile stroke,
  And moral mildew kept the cut in cloak.
  Happy the man, I say, to whom the wage
  Of sin has been commuted into age.
  Yet not <i>quite</i> happy&mdash;hark, that horrid cry!&mdash;
  His cruel mirror wounds him in the eye!

A VISION OF CLIMATE</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  I dreamed that I was poor and sick and sad,
    Broken in hope and weary of my life;
  My ventures all miscarrying&mdash;naught had
    For all my labor in the heat and strife.
    And in my heart some certain thoughts were rife
  Of an unsummoned exit. As I lay
    Considering my bitter state, I cried:
  "Alas! that hither I did ever stray.
    Better in some fair country to have died
  Than live in such a land, where Fortune never
  (Unless he be successful) crowns Endeavor."

  Then, even as I lamented, lo! there came
    A troop of Presences&mdash;I knew not whence
  Nor what they were: thought cannot rightly name
    What's known through spiritual evidence,
    Reported not by gross material sense.
  "Why come ye here?" I seemed to cry (though naught
    My sleeping tongue did utter) to the first&mdash;
  "What are ye?&mdash;with what woful message fraught?
    Ye have a ghastly look, as ye had burst
  Some sepulcher in memory. Weird creatures,
  I'm sure I'd know you if ye had but features."

  Some subtle organ noted the reply
    (Inaudible to ear of flesh the tone):
  "The Finest Climate in the World am I,
    From Siskiyou to San Diego known&mdash;
    From the Sierra to the sea. The zone
  Called semi-tropical I've pulled about
    And placed it where it does most good, I trust.
  I shake my never-failing bounty out
    Alike upon the just and the unjust."
  "That's very true," said I, "but when 'tis shaken
  My share by the unjust is ever taken."

  "Permit me," it resumed, "now to present
    My eldest son, the Champagne Atmosphere,
  And others to rebuke your discontent&mdash;
    The Mammoth Squash, Strawberry All the Year,
    The fair No Lightning&mdash;flashing only here&mdash;
  The Wholesome Earthquake and Italian Sky,
    With its Unstriking Sun; and last, not least,
  The Compos Mentis Dog. Now, ingrate, try
    To bring a better stomach to the feast:
  When Nature makes a dance and pays the piper,
    To be unhappy is to be a viper!"

  "Why, yet," said I, "with all your blessings fine
    (And Heaven forbid that I should speak them ill)
  I yet am poor and sick and sad. Ye shine
    With more of splendor than of heat: for still,
    Although my will is warm, my bones are chill."
  "Then warm you with enthusiasm's blaze&mdash;
    Fortune waits not on toil," they cried; "O then
  Join the wild chorus clamoring our praise&mdash;
    Throw up your beaver and throw down you pen!"
  "Begone!" I shouted. They bewent, a-smirking,
    And I, awakening, fell straight a-working.

  "What does it mean?" I asked a wight

  "A mass for the repose," he said,
    "Of Colonel Markham's"&mdash;&mdash;"What,

    'Tis sad, 'tis sad, God wot!"

  "A mass"&mdash;repeated he, and rose

  Mahomet Stanford, with covetous stare,
  Gazed on a vision surpassingly fair:
  Far on the desert's remote extreme
  A mountain of gold with a mellow gleam
  Reared its high pinnacles into the sky,
  The work of <i>mirage</i> to delude the eye.
  Pixley Pasha, at the Prophet's feet
  Piously licking them, swearing them sweet,
  Ventured, observing his master's glance,
  To beg that he order the mountain's advance.
  Mahomet Stanford exerted his will,
  Commanding: "In Allah's name, hither, hill!"
  Never an inch the mountain came.
  Mahomet Stanford, with face aflame,
  Lifted his foot and kicked, alack!
  Pixley Pasha on the end of the back.
  Mollified thus and smiling free,
  He said: "Since the mountain won't come to me,
  I'll go to the mountain." With infinite pains,
  Camels in caravans, negroes in trains,
  Warriors, workmen, women, and fools,
  Food and water and mining tools
  He gathered about him, a mighty array,
  And the journey began at the close of day.
  All night they traveled&mdash;at early dawn
  Many a wearisome league had gone.
  Morning broke fair with a golden sheen,
  Mountain, alas, was nowhere seen!
  Mahomet Stanford pounded his breast,
  Pixley Pasha he thus addressed:
  "Dog of mendacity, cheat and slave,
  May jackasses sing o'er your grandfather's grave!"

  Making a lot of individual Hells
  In gentlemen instinctively who shrink

  You talk as I should if some world I trod

  Souls less indubitably white

TIDINGS OF GOOD</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Old Nick from his place of last resort
    Came up and looked the world over.
  He saw how the grass of the good was short
    And the wicked lived in clover.

  And he gravely said: "This is all, all wrong,
    And never by me intended.
  If to me the power should ever belong
    I shall have this thing amended."

  He looked so solemn and good and wise
    As he made this observation
  That the men who heard him believed their eyes
    Instead of his reputation.

  So they bruited the matter about, and each
    Reported the words as nearly
  As memory served&mdash;with additional speech
    To bring out the meaning clearly.

  The consequence was that none understood,
    And the wildest rumors started
  Of something intended to help the good
    And injure the evil-hearted.

  Then Robert Morrow was seen to smile
    With a bright and lively joyance.
  "A man," said he, "that is free from guile
    Will now be free from annoyance.

  "The Featherstones doubtless will now increase
    And multiply like the rabbits,
  While jailers, deputy sheriffs, police,
    And writers will form good habits.

  "The widows more easily robbed will be,
    And no juror will ever heed 'em,
  But open his purse to my eloquent plea
    For security, gain, or freedom."

  When Benson heard of the luck of the good
    (He was eating his dinner) he muttered:
  "It cannot help <i>me</i>, for 'tis understood
    My bread is already buttered.

  "My plats of surveys are all false, they say,
    But that cannot greatly matter
  To me, for I'll tell the jurors that they
    May lick, if they please, my platter."

  Both bowed, and the Evil One opened his mind
    Concerning the business that brought him:

  "For ten million years I've been kept in a stew
    Because you have thought me immoral;
  And though I have had my opinion of you,
    You've had the best end of the quarrel.

  "But now&mdash;well, I venture to hope that the past
    With its misunderstandings we'll smother;
  And you, sir, and I, sir, be throned here at last
    As equals, the one to the other."

  "Indeed!" said the Master (I cannot convey
    A sense of his tone by mere letters)
  "What makes you presume you'll be bidden to stay
    Up here on such terms with your betters?"

  "Why, sure you can't mean it!" said Satan. "I've seen

  Suggesting cats, and hinting kittens, too!)

  From fiddling, and the animals that grow
  The strings that groan to the tormenting bow
  Live undespoiled of their insides, resigned

  With Chilean birth your name but poorly tallies;
  The test is&mdash;Did you ever sell tamales?

  It matters very little, though, my boy,
  If you're from Chile or from Illinois;
  You can't, because you serve a foreign land,
  Spit with impunity on ours, expand,
  Cock-turkeywise, and strut with blind conceit,
  All heedless of the hearts beneath your feet,
  Fling falsehoods as a sower scatters grain
  And, for security, invoke disdain.
  Sir, there are laws that men of sense observe,
  No matter whence they come nor whom they serve&mdash;
  The laws of courtesy; and these forbid
  You to malign, as recently you did,
  As servant of another State, a State
  Wherein your duties all are concentrate;
  Branding its Ministers as rogues&mdash;in short,
  Inviting cuffs as suitable retort.

  Chileno or American, 'tis one&mdash;
  Of any land a citizen, or none&mdash;
  If like a new Thersites here you rail,
  Loading with libels every western gale,
  You'll feel the cudgel on your scurvy hump
  Impinging with a salutary thump.
  'Twill make you civil or 'twill make you jump!

IN UPPER SAN FRANCISCO</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  I heard that Heaven was bright and fair,
  And politicians dwelt not there.

  'Twas said by knowing ones that they
  Were in the Elsewhere&mdash;so to say.

  So, waking from my last long sleep,
  I took my place among the sheep.

  I passed the gate&mdash;Saint Peter eyed
  Me sharply as I stepped inside.

  He thought, as afterward I learned,
  That I was Chris, the Unreturned.

  The new Jerusalem&mdash;ah me,
  It was a sorry sight to see!

  The mansions of the blest were there,
  And mostly they were fine and fair;

  But O, such streets!&mdash;so deep and wide,
  And all unpaved, from side to side!

  And in a public square there grew
  A blighted tree, most sad to view.

  From off its trunk the bark was ripped&mdash;
  Its very branches all were stripped!

  An angel perched upon the fence
  With all the grace of indolence.

  "Celestial bird," I cried, in pain,
  "What vandal wrought this wreck? Explain."

  He raised his eyelids as if tired:
  "What is a Vandal?" he inquired.

  "This is the Tree of Life. 'Twas stripped
  By Durst and Siebe, who have shipped

  "The bark across the Jordan&mdash;see?&mdash;
  And sold it to a tannery."

  "Alas," I sighed, "their old-time tricks!
  That pavement, too, of golden bricks&mdash;

  "They've gobbled that?" But with a scowl,
  "You greatly wrong them," said the fowl:

  "'Twas Gilleran did that, I fear&mdash;
  Head of the Street Department here."

  "What! what!" cried I&mdash;"you let such chaps
  Come here? You've Satan, too, perhaps."

  "We had him, yes, but off he went,
  Yet showed some purpose to repent;

  "But since your priests and parsons filled
  The place with those their preaching killed"&mdash;

  (Here Siebe passed along with Durst,
  Psalming as if their lungs would burst)&mdash;

  "He swears his foot no more shall press
  ('Tis cloven, anyhow, I guess)

  "Our soil. In short, he's out on strike&mdash;
  But devils are not all alike."

  Lo! Gilleran came down the street,
  Pressing the soil with broad, flat feet!

  Dear Bruner, once we had a little talk

  About the manner of your moral walk:
    How devious the trail you made in stalking,
  On level ground, your law-protected game&mdash;
  "Another's Dollar" is, I think, its name.

  Your crooked course more recently is not
    So blamable; for, truly, you have stumbled
  On evil days; and 'tis your luckless lot
    To traverse spaces (with a spirit humbled,
  Contrite, dejected and divinely sad)
  Where, 'tis confessed, the walking's rather bad.

  Jordan, the song says, is a road (I thought
    It was a river) that is hard to travel;
  And Dublin, if you'd find it, must be sought
    Along a highway with more rocks than gravel.
  In difficulty neither can compete
  With that wherein you navigate your feet.

  As once George Gorham said of Pixley, so
    I say of you: "The prison yawns before you,
  The turnkey stalks behind!" Now will you go?
    Or lag, and let that functionary floor you?

TO AN INSOLENT ATTORNEY</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  So, Hall McAllister, you'll not be warned&mdash;
  My protest slighted, admonition scorned!
  To save your scoundrel client from a cell
  As loth to swallow him as he to swell
  Its sum of meals insurgent (it decries
  All wars intestinal with meats that rise)
  You turn your scurril tongue against the press
  And damn the agency you ought to bless.
  Had not the press with all its hundred eyes
  Discerned the wolf beneath the sheep's disguise
  And raised the cry upon him, he to-day
  Would lack your company, and you would lack his pay.

  Talk not of "hire" and consciences for sale&mdash;
  You whose profession 'tis to threaten, rail,
  Calumniate and libel at the will
  Of any villain who can pay the bill&mdash;
  You whose most honest dollars all were got
  By saying for a fee "the thing that's not!"
  To you 'tis one, to challenge or defend;
  Clients are means, their money is an end.
  In my profession sometimes, as in yours
  Always, a payment large enough secures
  A mercenary service to defend
  The guilty or the innocent to rend.
  But mark the difference, nor think it slight:
  <i>We</i> do not hold it proper, just and right;
  Of selfish lies a little still we shame
  And give our villainies another name.
  Hypocrisy's an ugly vice, no doubt,
  But blushing sinners can't get on without.
  Happy the lawyer!&mdash;at his favored hands
  Nor truth nor decency the world demands.
  Secure in his immunity from shame,
  His cheek ne'er kindles with the tell-tale flame.
  His brains for sale, morality for hire,
  In every land and century a licensed liar!

  No doubt, McAllister, you can explain
  How honorable 'tis to lie for gain,
  Provided only that the jury's made
  To understand that lying is your trade.
  A hundred thousand volumes, broad and flat,
  (The Bible not included) proving that,
  Have been put forth, though still the doubt remains
  If God has read them with befitting pains.
  No Morrow could get justice, you'll declare,
  If none who knew him foul affirmed him fair.
  Ingenious man! how easy 'tis to raise
  An argument to justify the course that pays!

  I grant you, if you like, that men may need
  The services performed for crime by greed,&mdash;
  Grant that the perfect welfare of the State
  Requires the aid of those who in debate
  As mercenaries lost in early youth
  The fine distinction between lie and truth&mdash;
  Who cheat in argument and set a snare
  To take the feet of Justice unaware&mdash;
  Who serve with livelier zeal when rogues assist
  With perjury, embracery (the list
  Is long to quote) than when an honest soul,
  Scorning to plot, conspire, intrigue, cajole,
  Reminds them (their astonishment how great!)
  He'd rather suffer wrong than perpetrate.
  I grant, in short, 'tis better all around
  That ambidextrous consciences abound
  In courts of law to do the dirty work
  That self-respecting scavengers would shirk.
  What then? Who serves however clean a plan
  By doing dirty work, he is a dirty man!

    That Ananias told
  He swore was true. He had no doubt
  That Daniel laid the lions out.
  In short, he had all holiness,
  All meekness and all lowliness,
    And was with saints enrolled.

  'Tis true, some slight excess of zeal
  Sincerely to promote the weal
    Of this most Christian state
  Had moved him rudely to divide
  The queue that was a pagan's pride,
  And in addition certify
  The Faith by making fur to fly
    From pelt as well as pate?

  But, Heavenly Father, thou dost know
  That in this town these actions go
    For nothing worth a name.
  Nay, every editorial ass,
  To prove they never come to pass
  Will damn his soul eternally,
  Although in his own journal he
    May read the printed shame.

  From bloody hands the reins of pow'r
  Fall slack; the high-decisive hour
    Strikes not for liars' ears.
  Remove, O Father, the disgrace
  That stains our California's face,
  And consecrate to human good
  The strength of her young womanhood
    And all her golden years!

TO EITHER</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
        Back further than
        I know, in San
  Francisco dwelt a wealthy man.
        So rich was he
        That none could be
  Wise, good and great in like degree.

        'Tis true he wrought,
        In deed or thought,
  But few of all the things he ought;
        But men said: "Who
        Would wish him to?
  Great souls are born to be, not do!"

        One thing, indeed,
        He did, we read,
  Which was becoming, all agreed:
        Grown provident,
        Ere life was spent
  He built a mighty monument.

        For longer than
        I know, in San
  Francisco lived a beggar man;
        And when in bed
        They found him dead&mdash;
  "Just like the scamp!" the people said.

        He died, they say,
        On the same day
  His wealthy neighbor passed away.
        What matters it
        When beggars quit
  Their beats? I answer: Not a bit.

        They got a spade
        And pick and made
  A hole, and there the chap was laid.
        "He asked for bread,"
        'Twas neatly said:
  "He'll get not even a stone instead."

        The years rolled round:
        His humble mound
  Sank to the level of the ground;
        And men forgot
        That the bare spot
  Was like (and was) the beggar's lot.

        Forgotten, too,
        Was t'other, who
  Had reared the monument to woo
        Inconstant Fame,
        Though still his name
  Shouted in granite just the same.

        That name, I swear,
        They both did bear
  The beggar and the millionaire.
        That lofty tomb,
        Then, honored&mdash;whom?
  For argument here's ample room.

        I'll not debate,
        But only state
  The scamp first claimed it at the Gate.
        St. Peter, proud
        To serve him, bowed
  And showed him to the softest cloud.

DISAPPOINTMENT</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  The Senate woke; the Chairman's snore
       Was stilled, its echoes balking;
  The startled members dreamed no more,
  For Steele, who long had held the floor,
       Had suddenly ceased talking.

  As, like Elijah, in his pride,
       He to his seat was passing,
  "Go up thou baldhead!" Reddy cried.
  Then six fierce bears ensued and tried
       To sunder him for "sassing."

  Two seized his legs, and one his head,
       The fourth his trunk, to munch on;
  The fifth preferred an arm instead;
  The last, with rueful visage, said:
       "Pray what have <i>I</i> for luncheon?"

  Then to that disappointed bear
       Said Steele, serene and chipper,

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Within my dark and narrow bed

  I heard above my fleshless head
    The grinding of a spade.

  A gruffer note ensued and grew
    To harsh and harsher strains:
  The poet Welcker then I knew
    Was "snatching" my remains.

  "O Welcker, let your hand be stayed
    And leave me here in peace.
  Of your revenge you should have made
    An end with my decease."

  "Hush, Mouldyshanks, and hear my moan:
    I once, as you're aware,
  Was eminent in letters&mdash;known
    And honored everywhere.

  "My splendor made all Berkeley bright
    And Sacramento blind.
  Men swore no writer e'er could write
    Like me&mdash;if I'd a mind.

  "With honors all insatiate,
    With curst ambition smit,
  Too far, alas! I tempted fate&mdash;
    I <i>published</i> what I'd writ!

  "Good Heaven! with what a hunger wild
    Oblivion swallows fame!
  Men who have known me from a child
    Forget my very name!

  "Even creditors with searching looks
    My face cannot recall;
  My heaviest one&mdash;he prints my books&mdash;
    Oblivious most of all.

  "O I should feel a sweet content
    If one poor dun his claim
  Would bring to me for settlement,
    And bully me by name.

  "My dog is at my gate forlorn;
    It howls through all the night,
  And when I greet it in the morn
    It answers with a bite!"

  "O Poet, what in Satan's name
    To me's all this ado?
  Will snatching me restore the fame
    That printing snatched from you?"

  "Peace, dread Remains; I'm not about

THE LAST MAN</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  I dreamed that Gabriel took his horn
  On Resurrection's fateful morn,
  And lighting upon Laurel Hill
  Blew long, blew loud, blew high and shrill.
  The houses compassing the ground
  Rattled their windows at the sound.
  But no one rose. "Alas!" said he,
  "What lazy bones these mortals be!"
  Again he plied the horn, again
  Deflating both his lungs in vain;
  Then stood astonished and chagrined
  At raising nothing but the wind.
  At last he caught the tranquil eye
  Of an observer standing by&mdash;
  Last of mankind, not doomed to die.
  To him thus Gabriel: "Sir, I pray
  This mystery you'll clear away.
  Why do I sound my note in vain?
  Why spring they not from out the plain?
  Where's Luning, Blythe and Michael Reese,
  Magee, who ran the <i>Golden Fleece?</i>
  Where's Asa Fisk? Jim Phelan, who
  Was thought to know a thing or two
  Of land which rose but never sank?
  Where's Con O'Conor of the Bank,
  And all who consecrated lands
  Of old by laying on of hands?
  I ask of them because their worth
  Was known in all they wished&mdash;the earth.
  Brisk boomers once, alert and wise,
  Why don't they rise, why don't they rise?"
  The man replied: "Reburied long
  With others of the shrouded throng
  In San Mateo&mdash;carted there
  And dumped promiscuous, anywhere,
  In holes and trenches&mdash;all misfits&mdash;
  Mixed up with one another's bits:
  One's back-bone with another's shin,
  A third one's skull with a fourth one's grin&mdash;
  Your eye was never, never fixed
  Upon a company so mixed!
  Go now among them there and blow:
  'Twill be as good as any show
  To see them, when they hear the tones,
  Compiling one another's bones!
  But here 'tis vain to sound and wait:
  Naught rises here but real estate.
  I own it all and shan't disgorge.
  Don't know me? I am Henry George."

  The hopper singing in the grass

  He penetrates the spider's veil,
    Industriously pillages

  And shadows home the snail.

  He lightly runs to earth the quaint

ONE OF THE REDEEMED</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Saint Peter, standing at the Gate, beheld
  A soul whose body Death had lately felled.

  A pleasant soul as ever was, he seemed:
  His step was joyous and his visage beamed.

  "Good morning, Peter." There was just a touch
  Of foreign accent, but not overmuch.

  The Saint bent gravely, like a stately tree,
  And said: "You have the advantage, sir, of me."

  "Rinan of Paris," said the immortal part&mdash;
  "A master of the literary art.

  "I'm somewhat famous, too, I grieve to tell,
  As controversialist and infidel."

  "That's of no consequence," the Saint replied,
  "Why, I myself my Master once denied.

  "No one up here cares anything for that.
  But is there nothing you were always at?

  "It seems to me you were accused one day
  Of <i>something</i>&mdash;what it was I can't just say."

  "Quite likely," said the other; "but I swear
  My life was irreproachable and fair."

  Just then a soul appeared upon the wall,
  Singing a hymn as loud as he could bawl.

  About his head a golden halo gleamed,
  As well befitted one of the redeemed.

  A harp he bore and vigorously thumbed,
  Strumming he sang, and, singing, ever strummed.

  His countenance, suffused with holy pride,
  Glowed like a pumpkin with a light inside.

  "Ah! that's the chap," said Peter, "who declares:
  'Rinan's a rake and drunkard&mdash;smokes and swears.'

  "Yes, that's the fellow&mdash;he's a preacher&mdash;came
  From San Francisco. Mansfield was his name."

  "Do you believe him?" said Rinan. "Great Scott!
  Believe? Believe the blackguard? Of course <i>not!</i>

  "Just walk right in and make yourself at home.
  And if he pecks at you I'll cut his comb.

  "He's only here because the Devil swore
  He wouldn't have him, for the smile he wore."

  Resting his eyes one moment on that proof
  Of saving grace, the Frenchman turned aloof,

  And stepping down from cloud to cloud, said he:
  "Thank you, monsieur,&mdash;I'll see if he'll have <i>me</i>."

A QUESTION OF ELIGIBILITY</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  It was a bruised and battered chap
  The victim of some dire mishap,
  Who sat upon a rock and spent
  His breath in this ungay lament:

  "Some wars&mdash;I've frequent heard of such&mdash;
  Has beat the everlastin' Dutch!
  But never fight was fit by man
  To equal this which has began
  In our (I'm in it, if you please)
  Academy of Sciences.
  For there is various gents belong
  To it which go persistent wrong,
  And loving the debates' delight
  Calls one another names at sight.
  Their disposition, too, accords
  With fighting like they all was lords!
  Sech impulses should be withstood:
  'Tis scientific to be good.

  "'Twas one of them, one night last week,
  Rose up his figure for to speak:
  'Please, Mr. Chair, I'm holding here
  A resolution which, I fear,
  Some ancient fossils that has bust
  Their cases and shook off their dust
  To sit as Members here will find
  Unpleasant, not to say unkind.'
  And then he read it every word,
  And silence fell on all which heard.
  That resolution, wild and strange,
  Proposed a fundamental change,
  Which was that idiots no more
  Could join us as they had before!

  "No sooner was he seated than
  The members rose up, to a man.
  Each chap was primed with a reply
  And tried to snatch the Chairman's eye.
  They stomped and shook their fists in air,
  And, O, what words was uttered there!

  "The Chair was silent, but at last
  He hove up his proportions vast
  And stilled them tumults with a look
  By which the undauntedest was shook.
  He smiled sarcastical and said:
  'If Argus was the Chair, instead
  Of me, he'd lack enough of eyes
  Each orator to recognize!
  And since, denied a hearing, you
  Might maybe undertake to do
  Each other harm before you cease,
  I've took some steps to keep the peace:
  I've ordered out&mdash;alas, alas,
  That Science e'er to such a pass
  Should come!&mdash;I've ordered out&mdash;the gas!'

  "O if a tongue or pen of fire
  Was mine I could not tell entire
  What the ensuin' actions was.
  When swollered up in darkness' jaws
  We fit and fit and fit and fit,
  And everything we felt we hit!
  We gouged, we scratched and we pulled hair,
  And O, what words was uttered there!
  And when at last the day dawn came
  Three hundred Scientists was lame;
  Two hundred others couldn't stand,
  They'd been so careless handled, and
  One thousand at the very least
  Was spread upon the floor deceased!
  'Twere easy to exaggerate,
  But lies is things I mortal hate.

  "Such, friends, is the disaster sad
  Which has befel the Cal. Acad.
  And now the question is of more
  Importance than it was before:
  Shall vacancies among us be
  To idiots threw open free?"

  As harshly as a jaybird in a pine,
    And with as little sense of wrong and right
  As animates that irritable creature,
  Is not a very venerable feature.

  You damn all witnesses, all jurors too
    (And swear at the attorneys, I suppose,
  But <i>that's</i> commendable) "till all is blue";
    And what it's all about, the good Lord knows,
    Not you; but all the hotter, fiercer glows
  Your wrath for that&mdash;as dogs the louder howl
    With only moonshine to incite their rage,
  And bears with more ferocious menace growl,
    Even when their food is flung into the cage.
  Reform, your Honor, and forbear to curse us.
  Lest all men, hearing you, cry: "<i>Ecce ursus</i>!"

AD MOODIUM</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Tut! Moody, do not try to show
    To gentlemen and ladies
  That if they have not "Faith," they'll go
      Headlong to Hades.

  Faith is belief; and how can I
    Have that by being willing?
  This dime I cannot, though I try,
      Believe a shilling.

  Perhaps you can. If so, pray do&mdash;
    Believe you own it, also.
  But what seems evidence to you
      I may not call so.

  Heaven knows I'd like the Faith to think
    This little vessel's contents
  Are liquid gold. I see 'tis ink
      For writing nonsense.

  Minds prone to Faith, however, may
    Come now and then to sorrow:
  They put their trust in truth to-day,
      In lies to-morrow.

  No doubt the happiness is great
    To think as one would wish to;
  But not to swallow every bait,
      As certain fish do.

  To think a snake a cord, I hope,
    Would bolden and delight me;
  But some day I might think a rope
      Would chase and bite me.

  "Curst Reason! Faith forever blest!"
    You're crying all the season.
  Well, who decides that Faith is best?
      Why, Mr. Reason.

  He's right or wrong; he answers you
    According to your folly,
  And says what you have taught him to,
      Like any polly.

THE VAN NESSIAD</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  From end to end, thine avenue, Van Ness,
  Rang with the cries of battle and distress!
  Brave lungs were thundering with dreadful sound
  And perspiration smoked along the ground!
  Sing, heavenly muse, to ears of mortal clay,
  The meaning, cause and finish of the fray.

  Great Porter Ashe (invoking first the gods,
  Who signed their favor with assenting nods
  That snapped off half their heads&mdash;their necks grown dry
  Since last the nectar cup went circling by)
  Resolved to build a stable on his lot,
  His neighbors fiercely swearing he should not.
  Said he: "I build that stable!" "No, you don't,"
  Said they. "I can!" "You can't!" "I will!" "You won't!"
  "By heaven!" he swore; "not only will I build,
  But purchase donkeys till the place is filled!"
  "Needless expense," they sneered in tones of ice&mdash;
  "The owner's self, if lodged there, would suffice."
  For three long months the awful war they waged:
  With women, women, men with men engaged,
  While roaring babes and shrilling poodles raged!

  Jove, from Olympus, where he still maintains
  His ancient session (with rheumatic pains
  Touched by his long exposure) marked the strife,
  Interminable but by loss of life;
  For malediction soon exhausts the breath&mdash;
  If not, old age itself is certain death.
  Lo! he holds high in heaven the fatal beam;
  A golden pan depends from each, extreme;
  This feels of Porter's fate the downward stress,
  That bears the destiny of all Van Ness.
  Alas! the rusted scales, their life all gone,
  Deliver judgment neither pro nor con:
  The dooms hang level and the war goes on.
  With a divine, contemptuous disesteem
  Jove dropped the pans and kicked, himself, the beam:
  Then, to decide the strife, with ready wit,
  The nickel that he did not care for it
  Twirled absently, remarking: "See it spin:
  Head, Porter loses; tail, the others win."
  The conscious nickel, charged with doom, spun round,
  Portentously and made a ringing sound,
  Then, staggering beneath its load of fate,
  Sank rattling, died at last and lay in state.

  Jove scanned the disk and then, as is his wont,
  Raised his considering orbs, exclaiming: "Front!"
  With leisurely alacrity approached
  The herald god, to whom his mind he broached:
  "In San Francisco two belligerent Powers,
  Such as contended round great Ilion's towers,
  Fight for a stable, though in either class
  There's not a horse, and but a single ass.
  Achilles Ashe, with formidable jaw
  Assails a Trojan band with fierce hee-haw,
  Firing the night with brilliant curses. They
  With dark vituperation gloom the day.
  Fate, against which nor gods nor men compete,
  Decrees their victory and his defeat.
  With haste, good Mercury, betake thee hence
  And salivate him till he has no sense!"

  Sheer downward shot the messenger afar,
  Trailing a splendor like a falling star!
  With dimming lustre through the air he burned,
  Vanished, nor till another sun returned.
  The sovereign of the gods superior smiled,
  Beaming benignant, fatherly and mild:
  "Is Destiny's decree performed, my lad?&mdash;
  And has he now no sense?" "Ah, sire, he never had."

  Well, Towser (I'm thinking your name must be Towser),
    You're a decentish puppy as puppy dogs go,
  For you never, I'm sure, could have dined upon trowser,
    And your tail's unimpeachably curled just so.

  But, dear me! your name&mdash;if 'tis yours&mdash;is a "poser":
    Its meaning I cannot get anywise at,
  When spoken correctly perhaps it is Toser,
    And means one who toses. Max Muller, how's that?

  I ne'er was ingenious at all at divining
    A word's prehistorical, primitive state,
  Or finding its root, like a mole, by consigning
    Its bloom to the turnep-top's sorrowful fate.

  And, now that I think of it well, I'm no nearer
   The riddle's solution than ever&mdash;for how's
  My pretty invented word, "tose," any clearer
    In point of its signification than "towse"?

  So, Towser (or Toser), I mean to rename you
    In honor of some good and eminent man,
  In the light and the heat of whose quickening fame you
    May grow to an eminent dog if you can.

  In sunshine like his you'll not long be a croucher:
   The Senate shall hear you&mdash;for that I will vouch.
  Come here, sir. Stand up. I rechristen you Goucher.

  They bloat on the war-plain with ink all asoak,

  His foes with corruption, his friends by the line.
  The thunders are stilled of the horrid campaign,
  De Young is triumphant, and never again
  Will he need, with his life in his hand, to roar:
  "Count fair or, by G&mdash;&mdash;, I will die on your floor!"

  O Buddha, had you but foreknown

  It would have made you twist and moan

  You would have damned the entire lot
  And turned a Christian, would you not?

  There were no Christians, I'll allow,
    In your day; that would only
  Have brought distinction. Even now
    A Christian might feel lonely.
  All take the name, but facts are things
  As stubborn as the will of kings.

  The records, could we read, might show

  And yet the fact I can't disguise
  That Deacon Rankin's good and wise.

  'Tis true he is not quite a priest,
    Nor more than half a preacher;
  But he exhorts as loud at least
    As any living creature.

  He never takes a penny out.

  Bloated and bald, or curdled in a clot,

  To hide from human eyes its faded charms?

  If not to works of piety inclined,
  Then recreation might have claimed his mind.

  To cinch the shorts and make the market bleed[A]
  Is better sport than victimizing Creed;
  And a far livelier satisfaction comes
  Of knowing Simon, autocrat of thumbs.[B]
  If neither worthy work nor play command
  This gentleman of leisure's heart and hand,
  Then Mammon might his idle spirit lift
  By hope of profit to some deed of thrift.
  Is there no cheese to pare, no flint to skin,
  No tin to mend, no glass to be put in,
  No housewife worthy of a morning visit,
  Her rags and sacks and bottles to solicit?
  Lo! the blind sow's precarious pursuit
  Of the aspiring oak's familiar fruit!&mdash;

  His graces, to exhibit 'em.
  He straddled in each attitude,
  Four parallels of latitude&mdash;

    Transcended her ability

  "I think that life in this secluded spot
  Agrees with men of your trade, does it not?"

  "Well, yes," said Goldenson, "I can't complain:
    Life anywhere&mdash;provided it is mine&mdash;
  Agrees with me; but I observe with pain
    That still the people murmur and repine.
  It hurts their sense of harmony, no doubt,
  To see a persecuted man grow stout."

  "O no, 'tis not your growing stout," said Death,
    "Which makes these malcontents complain and scold&mdash;
  They like you to be, somehow, scant of breath.
    What they object to is your growing old.
  And&mdash;though indifferent to lean or fat&mdash;

               I've got the range.

  PICKERING:
                                   Hooray! hooray!
  A grand good shot, and Teddy Colton's down:
  It burst in thunderbolts upon his crown!
  Larry O'Crocker drops his pick and flies,
  And deafening odors scream along the skies!
  Pelt 'em some more.

  FITCH:

                   There's nothing left but tar&mdash;
  wish I were a Yahoo.

  PICKERING:

                     Well, you are.
  But keep the tar. How well I recollect,
  When Mike was in with us&mdash;proud, strong, erect&mdash;
  <i>Mens conscia recti</i>&mdash;flinging mud, he stood,
  Austerely brave, incomparably good,
  Ere yet for filthy lucre he began
  To drive a cart as Stanford's hired man,
  That pitch-pot bearing in his hand, Old Nick
  Appeared and tarred us all with the same stick.
                             <i>(Enter Old Nick)</i>.
  I hope he won't return and use his arts
  To make us part with our immortal parts.

  OLD NICK:

  Make yourself easy on that score my lamb;
  For both your souls I wouldn't give a damn!
  I want my tar-pot&mdash;hello! where's the stick?

  FITCH:

  Don't look at <i>me</i> that fashion!&mdash;look at Pick.

  PICKERING:

  Forgive me, father&mdash;pity my remorse!
  Truth is&mdash;Mike took that stick to spank his horse.
  It fills my pericardium with grief
  That I kept company with such a thief.

  (<i>Endeavoring to get his handkerchief, he opens his coat and
  the tar-stick falls out. Nick picks it up, looks at the culprit
  reproachfully and withdraws in tears.</i>)

  FITCH (<i>excitedly</i>):

  O Pickering, come hither to the brink&mdash;
  There's something going on down there, I think!
  With many an upward smile and meaning wink
  The navvies all are running from the cut
  Like lunatics, to right and left&mdash;

  PICKERING:
                                     Tut, tut&mdash;
  'Tis only some poor sport or boisterous joke.
  Let us sit down and have a quiet smoke.
                           (<i>They sit and light cigars.</i>)

        FITCH (<i>singing</i>):

      When first I met Miss Toughie
        I smoked a fine cigyar,
      An' I was on de dummy
        And she was in de cyar.

        BOTH (<i>singing</i>):

      An' I was on de dummy
        And she was in de cyar.

        FITCH (<i>singing</i>):

      I couldn't go to her,
        An' she wouldn't come to me;
      An' I was as oneasy
        As a gander on a tree.

        BOTH (<i>singing</i>):

      An' I was as oneasy
        As a gander on a tree.

        FITCH (<i>singing</i>):

      But purty soon I weakened
        An' lef' de dummy's bench,
      An' frew away a ten-cent weed
        To win a five-cent wench!

        BOTH (<i>singing</i>)

      An' frew away a ten-cent weed
        To win a five-cent wench!

  FITCH:

  Is there not now a certain substance sold
  Under the name of fulminate of gold,
  A high explosive, popular for blasting,
  Producing an effect immense and lasting?

  PICKERING:

  Nay, that's mere superstition. Rocks are rent
  And excavations made by argument.
  Explosives all have had their day and season;
  The modern engineer relies on reason.
  He'll talk a tunnel through a mountain's flank
  And by fair speech cave down the tallest bank.

  (<i>The earth trembles, a deep subterranean explosion is heard
  and a section of the bank as big as El Capitan starts away and
  plunges thunderously into the cut. A part of it strikes De
  Young's dumpcart abaft the axletree and flings him, hurtling,
  skyward, a thing of legs and arms, to descend on the distant
  mountains, where it is cold. Fitch and Pickering pull themselves
  out of the dibris and stand ungraveling their eyes and
  noses.</i>)

  FITCH:

  Well, since I'm down here I will help to grade,
  And do dirt-throwing henceforth with a spade.

  PICKERING:

  God bless my soul! it gave me quit a start.
  Well, fate is fate&mdash;I guess I'll drive this cart.

METEMPSYCHOSIS</h2>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  DRAMATIS PERSONF.

  ST. JOHN                        <i>a Presidential Candidate</i>
  MCDONALD                             <i>a Defeated Aspirant</i>
  MRS. HAYES                               <i>an Ex-President</i>
  PITTS-STEVENS                              <i>a Water Nymph</i>

  <i>Scene</i>&mdash;A Small Lake in the Alleghany Mountains.

  ST. JOHN:

  Hours I've immersed my muzzle in this tarn
  And, quaffing copious potations, tried
  To suck it dry; but ever as I pumped
  Its waters into my distended skin
  The labor of my zeal extruded them
  In perspiration from my pores; and so,
  Rilling the marginal declivity,
  They fell again into their source. Ah, me!
  Could I but find within these ancient hills
  Some long extinct volcano, by the rains
  Of countless ages in its crater brimmed
  Like a full goblet, I would lay me down
  Prone on the outer slope, and o'er its edge
  Arching my neck, I'd siphon out its store
  And flood the valleys with my sweat for aye.
  So should I be accounted as a god,
  Even as Father Nilus is. What's that?
  Methought I heard some sawyer draw his file
  With jarring, stridulous cacophany
  Across his notchy blade, to set its teeth
  And mine on edge. Ha! there it goes again!

  <i>Song, within</i>.

    Cold water's the milk of the mountains,
      And Nature's our wet-nurse. O then,
    Glue thou thy blue lips to her fountains
      Forever and ever, amen!

  ST. JOHN:

  Why surely there's congenial company
  Aloof&mdash;the spirit, I suppose, that guards
  This sacred spot; perchance some water-nymph
  Who laving in the crystal flood her limbs
  Has taken cold, and so, with raucous voice
  Afflicts the sensitive membrane of mine ear
  The while she sings my sentiments.
                       <i>(Enter Pitts-Stevens.)</i>
                                      Hello!
  What fiend is this?

  PITTS-STEVENS:

  'Tis I, be not afraid.

  ST. JOHN:

  And who, thou antiquated crone, art thou?
  I ne'er forget a face, but names I can't
  So well remember. I have seen thee oft.
  When in the middle season of the night,
  Curved with a cucumber, or knotted hard
  With an eclectic pie, I've striven to keep
  My head and heels asunder, thou has come,
  With sociable familiarity,
  Into my dream, but not, alas, to bless.

  PITTS-STEVENS:

  My name's Pitts-Stevens, age just seventeen years;
  Talking teetotaler, professional
  Beauty.

  ST. JOHN:

  What dost thou here?

  PITTS-STEVENS:

  I'm come, fair sir,
  With paint and brush to blazon on these rocks
  The merits of my master's nostrum&mdash;so:
                                  <i>(Paints rapidly.)</i>
  "McDonald's Vinegar Bitters!"

  ST. JOHN:

  What are they?

  PITTS-STEVENS:

  A woman suffering from widowhood
  Took a full bottle and was cured. A man
  There was&mdash;a murderer; the doctors all
  Had given him up&mdash;he'd but an hour to live.
  He swallowed half a glassful. He is dead,
  But not of Vinegar Bitters. A wee babe
  Lay sick and cried for it. The mother gave
  That innocent a spoonful and it smoothed
  Its pathway to the tomb. 'Tis warranted
  To cause a boy to strike his father, make
  A pig squeal, start the hair upon a stone,
  Or play the fiddle for a country dance.
  <i>(Enter McDonald, reading a Sunday-school book.)</i>
  Good morrow, sir; I trust you're well.

  MCDONALD:

  H'lo, Pitts!
  Observe, good friends, I have a volume here
  Myself am author of&mdash;a noble book
  To train the infant mind (delightful task!)
  It tells how one Samantha Brown, age, six,
  A gutter-bunking slave to rum, was saved
  By Vinegar Bitters, went to church and now
  Has an account at the Pacific Bank.
  I'll read the whole work to you.

  ST JOHN:
                                  Heaven forbid!
  I've elsewhere an engagement.

  PITTS-STEVENS:
                               I am deaf.

  MCDONALD <i>(reading regardless):</i>

  "Once on a time there lived"&mdash;&mdash;

  <i>(Enter Mrs. Hayes.)</i>
                                  Behold our queen!

  ALL:

  Her eyes upon the ground
    Before her feet she low'rs,
  Walking, in thought profound,
    As 'twere, upon all fours.
  Her visage is austere,
    Her gait a high parade;
  At every step you hear
    The sloshing lemonade!

  MRS. HAYES <i>(to herself):</i>

  Once, sitting in the White House, hard at work
  Signing State papers (Rutherford was there,
  Knitting some hose) a sudden glory fell
  Upon my paper. I looked up and saw
  An angel, holding in his hand a rod
  Wherewith he struck me. Smarting with the blow
  I rose and (cuffing Rutherford) inquired:
  "Wherefore this chastisement?" The angel said:
  "Four years you have been President, and still
  There's rum!"&mdash;then flew to Heaven. Contrite, I swore
  Such oath as lady Methodist might take,
  My second term should medicine my first.
  The people would not have it that way; so
  I seek some candidate who'll take my soul&mdash;
  My spirit of reform, fresh from my breast,
  And give me his instead; and thus equipped
  With my imperious and fiery essence,
  Drive the Drink-Demon from the land and fill
  The people up with water till their teeth
  Are all afloat.

                      (<i>St. John discovers himself</i>.)
            What, <i>you</i>?

  ST. JOHN:

                      Aye, Madam, I'll
  Swap souls with you and lead the cold sea-green
  Amphibians of Prohibition on,
  Pallid of nose and webbed of foot, swim-bladdered,
  Gifted with gills, invincible!

  MRS. HAYES:

                      Enough,
  Stand forth and consummate the interchange.

  (<i>While McDonald and Pitts-Stevens modestly turn their
  backs, the latter blushing a delicate shrimp-pink, St. John and
  Mrs. Hayes effect an exchange of immortal parts. When the
  transfer is complete McDonald turns and advances, uncorking
  a bottle of Vinegar Bitters</i>.)

  MCDONALD (<i>chanting</i>):

      Nectar compounded of simples
        Cocted in Stygian shades&mdash;
      Acids of wrinkles and pimples
        From faces of ancient maids&mdash;
      Acrid precipitates sunken
        From tempers of scolding wives
      Whose husbands, uncommonly drunken,
        Are commonly found in dives,&mdash;
      With this I baptize and appoint thee
                                          (<i>to St. John</i>.)
        To marshal the vinophobe ranks.
      In the name of Dambosh I anoint thee
                     (<i>pours the liquid down St. John's back</i>.)
        As King of aquatical cranks!

  (<i>The liquid blisters the royal back, and His Majesty starts
  on a dead run, energetically exclaiming. Exit St. John</i>.)

  MRS. HAYES:

  My soul! My soul! I'll never get it back
  Unless I follow nimbly on his track.
                                    (<i>Exit Mrs. Hayes</i>.)

  PITTS-STEVENS:

  O my! he's such a beautiful young man!
  I'll follow, too, and catch him if I can.
                                       (<i>Exit Pitts-Stevens</i>.)

  MCDONALD:

  He scarce is visible, his dust so great!
  Methinks for so obscure a candidate
  He runs quite well. But as for Prohibition&mdash;
  I mean myself to hold the first position.

  (<i>Produces a pocket flask, topes a cruel quantity of double-distilled
  thunder-and-lightning out of it, smiles so grimly as to
  darken all the stage and sings</i>):

      Though fortunes vary let all be merry,
        And then if e'er a disaster befall,
      At Styx's ferry is Charon's wherry
              In easy call.

      Upon a ripple of golden tipple
        That tipsy ship'll convey you best.
      To king and cripple, the bottle's the nipple
              Of Nature's breast!

  NOZZLE:

  My friends, since '51 I have pursued
  The evil tenor of my watery way,
  Removing hills as by an act of faith&mdash;

  RINGDIVVY:

  Just so; the steadfast faith of those who hold,
  In foreign lands beyond the Eastern sea,
  The shares in your concern&mdash;a simple, blind,
  Unreasoning belief in dividends,
  Still stimulated by assessments which,
  When the skies fall, ensnaring all the larks,
  Will bring, no doubt, a very great return.

  ALL (<i>singing</i>):

          O the beautiful assessment,
          The exquisite assessment,
          The regular assessment,
            That makes the water flow.

  RINGDIVVY:

          The rascally-assessment!

  FEEGOBBLE:

          The murderous assessment!

  NOZZLE:

          The glorious assessment
            That makes my mare to go!

  FEEGOBBLE:

  But, Nozzle, you, I think, were on the point
  Of making a remark about some rights&mdash;
  Some certain vested rights you have acquired
  By long immunity; for still the law
  Holds that if one do evil undisturbed
  His right to do so ripens with the years;
  And one may be a villain long enough
  To make himself an honest gentleman.

  ALL (<i>singing</i>):

          Hail, holy law,

            Bows to thy dispensation.

  NOZZLE:

  Why, yes, I've floated mountains to the sea
  For lo! these many years; though some, they say,
  Do strand themselves along the bottom lands
  And cover up a village here and there,
  And here and there a ranch. 'Tis said, indeed,
  The granger with his female and his young
  Do not infrequently go to the dickens
  By premature burial in slickens.

  ALL (<i>singing</i>):

          Could slickens forever
          Choke up the river,
          And slime's endeavor
            Be tried on grain,
          How small the measure
          Of granger's treasure,
            How keen his pain!

  RINGDIVVY:

  "A consummation devoutly to be wished!"
  These rascal grangers would long since have been
  Submerged in slimes, to the last man of them,
  But for the fact that all their wicked tribes
  Affect our legislation with their bribes.

  ALL (<i>singing</i>):

          O bribery's great&mdash;
          'Tis a pillar of State,
            And the people they are free.

  FEEGOBBLE:

          It smashes my slate!

          It is thievery straight!

  RINGDIVVY:

          But it's been the making of me!

  I judge by certain shrewd sensations here
  In these callosities I call my thumbs&mdash;
  thrilling sense as of ten thousand pins,
  Red-hot and penetrant, transpiercing all
  The cuticle and tickling through the nerves&mdash;
  That some malign and awful thing draws near.

  HAYSEED:

        From the margin of the river
        (Bitter Creek, they sometimes call it)
        Where I cherished once the pumpkin,
        And the summer squash promoted,
        Harvested the sweet potato,
        Dallied with the fatal melon
        And subdued the fierce cucumber,
        I've been driven by the slickens,
        Driven by the slimes and tailings!
        All my family&mdash;my Polly
        Ann and all my sons and daughters,
        Dog and baby both included&mdash;
        All were swamped in seas of slickens,
        Buried fifty fathoms under,
        Where they lie, prepared to play their
        Gentle prank on geologic
        Gents that shall exhume them later,
        In the dim and distant future,
        Taking them for melancholy
        Relics antedating Adam.
        I alone got up and dusted.

  NOZZLE:

  Avaunt! you horrid and infernal cuss!
  What dire distress have you prepared for us?

  RINGDIVVY:

      Were I a buzzard stooping from the sky
        My craw with filth to fill,
      Into your honorable body I
        Would introduce a bill.

  FEEGOBBLE:

  Defendant, hence, or, by the gods, I'll brain thee!&mdash;
  Unless you saved some turneps to retain me.

  HAYSEED:

  As I was saying, I got up and dusted,
  My ranch a graveyard and my business busted!
  But hearing that a fellow from the City,
  Who calls himself a Citizens' Committee,
  Was coming up to play the very dickens,
  With those who cover up our farms with slickens,
  And make himself&mdash;unless I am in error&mdash;
  To all such miscreants a holy terror,
  I thought if I would join the dialogue
  I maybe might get payment for my dog.

  ALL (<i>Singing</i>):

  O the dog is the head of Creation,
    Prime work of the Master's hand;
  He hasn't a known occupation,
    Yet lives on the fat of the land.
  Adipose, indolent, sleek and orbicular,
  Sun-soaken, door matted, cross and particular,
  Men, women, children, all coddle and wait on him,
  Then, accidentally shutting the gate on him,
  Miss from their calves, ever after, the rifted out
  Mouthful of tendons that doggy has lifted out!
                                (<i>Enter Junket</i>.)

  JUNKET:

  Well met, my hearties! I must trouble you
  Jointly and severally to provide
  A comfortable carriage, with relays
  Of hardy horses. This Committee means
  To move in state about the country here.
  I shall expect at every place I stop
  Good beds, of course, and everything that's nice,
  With bountiful repast of meat and wine.
  For this Committee comes to sea and mark
  And inwardly digest.

  HAYSEED:

                     Digest my dog!

  NOZZLE:

  First square my claim for damages: the gold
  Escaping with the slickens keeps me poor!

  RINGDIVVY:

  I merely would remark that if you'd grease
  My itching palm it would more glibly glide
  Into the public pocket.

  FEEGOBBLE:

                     Sir, the wheels
  Of justice move but slowly till they're oiled.
  I have some certain writs and warrants here,
  Prepared against your advent. You recall
  The tale of Zaccheus, who did climb a tree,
  And Jesus said: "Come down"?

  JUNKET:

                     Why, bless your souls!
  I've got no money; I but came to see
  What all this noisy babble is about,
  Make a report and file the same away.

  NOZZLE, RINGDIVVY, FEEGOBBLE, HAYSEED:

  How'll that help <i>us</i>? Reports are not our style
  Of provender!

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  <i>Scene</i>&mdash;The Political Graveyard at Bone Mountain.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  DE YOUNG:

  This is the spot agreed upon. Here rest
  The sainted statesman who upon the field
  Of honor have at various times laid down
  Their own, and ended, ignominious,
  Their lives political. About me, lo!
  Their silent headstones, gilded by the moon,
  Half-full and near her setting&mdash;midnight. Hark!
  Through the white mists of this portentous night
  (Which throng in moving shapes about my way,
  As they were ghosts of candidates I've slain,
  To fray their murderer) my open ear,
  Spacious to maw the noises of the world,
  Engulfs a footstep.
               (<i>Enter Estee from his tomb.</i>)
                      Ah, 'tis he, my foe,
  True to appointment; and so here we fight&mdash;
  Though truly 'twas my firm belief that he
  Would send regrets, or I had not been here.

  ESTEE:

  O moon that hast so oft surprised the deeds
  Whereby I rose to greatness!&mdash;tricksy orb,
  The type and symbol of my politics,
  Now draw my ebbing fortunes to their flood,
  As, by the magic of a poultice, boils
  That burn ambitions with defeated fires
  Are lifted into eminence.
                           (<i>Sees De Young.</i>)
                           What? you!
  Faith, if I had suspected you would come
  From the fair world of politics wherein
  So lately you were whelped, and which, alas,
  I vainly to revisit strive, though still
  Rapped on the rotting head and bidden sleep
  Till Resurrection's morn,&mdash;if I had thought
  You would accept the challenge that I flung
  I would have seen you damned ere I came forth
  In the night air, shroud-clad and shivering,
  To fight so mean a thing! But since you're here,
  Draw and defend yourself. By gad, we'll <i>see</i>
  Who'll be Postmaster-General!

  DE YOUNG:

                                We will&mdash;
  I'll fight (for I am lame) with any blue
  And redolent remain that dares aspire
  To wreck the Grand Old Grandson's cabinet.
  Here's at you, nosegay!

  (<i>They draw tongues and are about to fight, when from an
  adjacent whited sepulcher, enter Swift.</i>)

  SWIFT:

                  Hold! put up your tongues!
  Within the confines of this sacred spot
  Broods such a holy calm as none may break
  By clash of weapons, without sacrilege.
            (<i>Beats down their tongues with a bone.</i>)
  Madmen! what profits it? For though you fought
  With such heroic skill that both survived,
  Yet neither should achieve the prize, for I
  Would wrest it from him. Let us not contend,
  But friendliwise by stipulation fix
  A slate for mutual advantage. Why,
  Having the pick and choice of seats, should we
  Forego them all but one? Nay, we'll take three,
  And part them so among us that to each
  Shall fall the fittest to his powers. In brief,
  Let us establish a Portfolio Trust.

  ESTEE:

                                      Agreed.

  DE YOUNG:

                  Aye, truly, 'tis a greed&mdash;and one
  The offices imperfectly will sate,
  But I'll stand in.

  SWIFT:

                     Well, so 'tis understood,
  As you're the junior member of the Trust,
  Politically younger and undead,
  Speak, Michael: what portfolio do you choose?

  DE YOUNG:

  I've thought the Postal service best would serve
  My interest; but since I have my pick,
  I'll take the War Department. It is known
  Throughout the world, from Market street to Pine,
  (For a Chicago journal told the tale)
  How in this hand I lately took my life
  And marched against great Buckley, thundering
  My mandate that he count the ballots fair!
  Earth heard and shrank to half her size! Yon moon,
  Which rivaled then a liver's whiteness, paused
  That night at Butchertown and daubed her face
  With sheep's blood! Then my serried rank I drew
  Back to my stronghold without loss. To mark
  My care in saving human life and limb,
  The Peace Society bestowed on me
  Its leather medal and the title, too,
  Of Colonel. Yes, my genius is for war. Good land!
  I naturally dote on a brass band!

                       (<i>Sings.</i>)

  O, give me a life on the tented field,
    Where the cannon roar and ring,
  Where the flag floats free and the foemen yield
    And bleed as the bullets sing.
  But be it not mine to wage the fray
  Where matters are ordered the other way,
    For that is a different thing.

  O, give me a life in the fierce campaign&mdash;
    Let it be the life of my foe:
  I'd rather fall upon him than the plain;
    That service I'd fain forego.
  O, a warrior's life is fine and free,
  But a warrior's death&mdash;ah me! ah me!
    That's a different thing, you know.

  ESTEE:

  Some claim I might myself advance to that
  Portfolio. When Rebellion raised its head,
  And you, my friends, stayed meekly in your shirts,
  I marched with banners to the party stump,
  Spat on my hands, made faces fierce as death,
  Shook my two fists at once and introduced
  Brave resolutions terrible to read!
  Nay, only recently, as you do know,
  I conquered Treason by the word of mouth,
  And slew, with Samson's weapon, the whole South!

  SWIFT:

  You once fought Stanford, too.

  ESTEE:

                                Enough of that&mdash;
  Give me the Interior and I'll devote
  My mind to agriculture and improve
  The breed of cabbages, especially
  The <i>Brassica Celeritatis</i>, named
  For <i>you</i> because in days of long ago
  You sold it at your market stall,&mdash;and, faith,
  'Tis said you were an honest huckster then.
  I'll be Attorney-General if you
  Prefer; for know I am a lawyer too!

  SWIFT:

  I never have heard that!&mdash;did you, De Young?

  DE YOUNG:

  Never, so help me! And I swear I've heard
  A score of Judges say that he is not.

  SWIFT (<i>to Estee</i>):

  You take the Interior. I might aspire
  To military station too, for once
  I led my party into Pixley's camp,
  And he paroled me. I defended, too,
  The State of Oregon against the sharp
  And bloody tooth of the Australian sheep.
  But I've an aptitude exceeding neat
  For bloodless battles of diplomacy.
  My cobweb treaty of Exclusion once,
  Through which a hundred thousand coolies sailed,
  Was much admired, but most by Colonel Bee.
  Though born a tinker I'm a diplomat
  From old Missouri, and I&mdash;ha! what's that?

  (<i>Exit Moon. Enter Blue Lights on all the tombs, and a
  circle of Red Fire on the grass; in the center the Spirit of
  Broken Hopes, and round about, a Troupe of Coffins, dancing
  and singing.</i>)

  CHORUS OF COFFINS:

          Two bodies dead and one alive&mdash;
            Yo, ho, merrily all!
          Now for boodle strain and strive&mdash;
            Buzzards all a-warble, O!
          Prophets three, agape for bread;
          Raven with a stone instead&mdash;
            Providential raven!
          Judges two and Colonel one&mdash;
          Run, run, rustics, run!
          But it's O, the pig is shaven,
            And oily, oily all!

  (<i>Exeunt Coffins, dancing. The Spirit of Broken Hopes
  advances, solemnly pointing at each of the Three Worthies in
  turn.</i>)

  SPIRIT OF BROKEN HOPES:

        Governor, Governor, editor man,
  Rusty, musty, spick-and-span,
  Harlequin, harridan, dicky-dout,
  Demagogue, charlatan&mdash;o, u, t, OUT!
                      (<i>De Young falls and sleeps.</i>)

      Antimonopoler, diplomat,
      Railroad lackey, political rat,
      One, two, three&mdash;SCAT!
                      (<i>Swift falls and sleeps.</i>)

  Boycotting chin-worker, working to woo
  Fortune, the fickle, to smile upon <i>you</i>,
  Jo-coated acrobat, shuttle-cock&mdash;SHOO!
                      (<i>Estee falls and sleeps.</i>)

      Now they lie in slumber sweet,
      Now the charm is all complete,
      Hasten I with flying feet
      Where beyond the further sea
      A babe upon its mother's knee
      Is gazing into skies afar
      And crying for a golden star.
      I'll drag a cloud across the blue
      And break that infant's heart in two!

  (<i>Exeunt the Spirit of Broken Hopes and the Red and Blue
  Fires. Re-enter Moon.</i>)

  ESTEE (<i>waking</i>):

  Why, this is strange! I dreamed I know not what,
  It seemed that certain apparitions were,
  Which sang uncanny words, significant
  And yet ambiguous&mdash;half-understood&mdash;
  Portending evil; and an awful spook,
  Even as I stood with my accomplices,
  Counted me out, as children do in play.
  Is that you, Mike?

  DE YOUNG <i>(waking):</i>

  It was.

  SWIFT <i>(waking):</i>

                     Am I all that?
  Then I'll reform my ways.
  <i>(Reforms his ways.)</i>
  Ah! had I known
  How sweet it is to be an honest man
  I never would have stooped to turn my coat
  For public favor, as chameleons take
  The hue (as near as they can judge) of that
  Supporting them. Henceforth I'll buy
  With money all the offices I need,
  And know the pleasure of an honest life,
  Or stay forever in this dismal place.
  Now that I'm good, it will no longer do
  To make a third with such, a wicked two.
  <i>(Returns to his tomb.)</i>

  DE YOUNG:

  Prophetic dream! by some good angel sent
  To make me with a quiet life content.
  The question shall no more my bosom irk,
  To go to Washington or go to work.
  From Fame's debasing struggle I'll withdraw,
  And taking up the pen lay down the law.
  I'll leave this rogue, lest my example make
  An honest man of him&mdash;his heart would break.
  <i>(Exit De Young.)</i>

  ESTEE:

  Out of my company these converts flee,
  But that advantage is denied to me:
  My curst identity's confining skin
  Nor lets me out nor tolerates me in.
  Well, since my hopes eternally have fled,
  And, dead before, I'm more than ever dead,
  To find a grander tomb be now my task,
  And pack my pork into a stolen cask.
  <i>(Exit, searching. Loud calls for the Author, who appears,
  bowing and smiling</i>.)

  AUTHOR <i>(singing):</i>

  Jack Satan's the greatest of gods,
    And Hell is the best of abodes.
  'Tis reached, through the Valley of Clods,
    By seventy different roads.
    Hurrah for the Seventy Roads!
  Hurrah for the clods that resound
  With a hollow, thundering sound!
    Hurrah for the Best of Abodes!

  We'll serve him as long as we've breath&mdash;
    Jack Satan the greatest of gods.
  To all of his enemies, death!&mdash;
    A home in the Valley of Clods.
    Hurrah for the thunder of clods
  That smother the soul of his foe!
  Hurrah for the spirits that go
    To dwell with the Greatest of Gods;

  SOOTYMUG                           <i>a Devil</i>

  <i>Scene</i>&mdash;the Dutch Flat Stage Road, at 12 P.M., on a Night
  of 1864.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  COWBOY CHARLEY:

  My boss, I fear she is delayed to-night.
  Already it is past the hour, and yet
  My ears have reached no sound of wheels; no note
  Melodious, of long, luxurious oaths
  Betokens the traditional dispute
  (Unsettled from the dawn of time) between
  The driver and off wheeler; no clear chant
  Nor carol of Wells Fargo's messenger
  Unbosoming his soul upon the air&mdash;
  his prowess to the tender-foot,
  And how at divers times in sundry ways
  He strewed the roadside with our carcasses.
  Clearly, the stage will not come by to-night.

  LELAND, THE KID:

  I now remember that but yesterday
  I saw three ugly looking fellows start
  From Colfax with a gun apiece, and they
  Did seem on business of importance bent.
  Furtively casting all their eyes about
  And covering their tracks with all the care
  That business men do use. I think perhaps
  They were Directors of that rival line,
  The great Pacific Mail. If so, they have
  Indubitably taken in that coach,
  And we are overreached. Three times before
  This thing has happened, and if once again
  These outside operators dare to cut
  Our rates of profit I shall quit the road
  And take my money out of this concern.
  When robbery no longer pays expense
  It loses then its chiefest charm for me,
  And I prefer to cheat&mdash;you hear me shout!

  HAPPY HUNTY:

  My chief, you do but echo back my thoughts:
  This competition is the death of trade.
  'Tis plain (unless we wish to go to work)
  Some other business we must early find.
  What shall it be? The field of usefulness
  Is yearly narrowing with the advance
  Of wealth and population on this coast.
  There's little left that any man can do
  Without some other fellow stepping in
  And doing it as well. If one essay
  To pick a pocket he is sure to feel
  (With what disgust I need not say to you)
  Another hand inserted in the same.
  You crack a crib at dead of night, and lo!
  As you explore the dining-room for plate
  You find, in session there, a graceless band
  Stuffing their coats with spoons, their skins with wine.
  And so it goes. Why even undertake
  To salt a mine and you will find it rich
  With noble specimens placed there before!

  LELAND, THE KID:

  And yet this line of immigration has
  Advantages superior to aught
  That elsewhere offers: all these passengers,
  If punched with care&mdash;

  COWBOY CHARLEY:

                     Significant remark!
  It opens up a prospect wide and fair,
  Suggesting to the thoughtful mind&mdash;<i>my</i> mind&mdash;
  A scheme that is the boss lay-out. Instead
  Of stopping passengers, let's carry them.
  Instead of crying out: "Throw up your hands!"
  Let's say: "Walk up and buy a ticket!" Why
  Should we unwieldy goods and bullion take,
  Watches and all such trifles, when we might
  Far better charge their value three times o'er
  For carrying them to market?

  LELAND, THE KID:

                                Put it there,
  Old son!

  HAPPY HUNTY:

            You take the cake, my dear. We'll build
  A mighty railroad through this pass, and then
  The stage folk will come up to us and squeal,
  And say: "It is bad medicine for both:
  What will you give or take?" And then we'll sell.

  COWBOY CHARLEY:

  Enlarge your notions, little one; this is
  No petty, slouching, opposition scheme,
  To be bought off like honest men and fools;
  Mine eye prophetic pierces through the mists
  That cloud the future, and I seem to see
  A well-devised and executed scheme
  Of wholesale robbery within the law
  (Made by ourselves)&mdash;great, permanent, sublime,
  And strong to grapple with the public throat&mdash;
  Shaking the stuffing from the public purse,
  The tears from bankrupt merchants' eyes, the blood
  From widows' famished carcasses, the bread
  From orphans' mouths!

  HAPPY HUNTY:

                        Hooray!

  LELAND, THE; KID:

                                Hooray!

  ALL:

                                        Hooray!

  <i>(They tear the masks from their faces, and discharging their
  shotguns, throw them into the chapparal. Then they join hands,
  dance and sing the following song:)</i>

  Ah! blesshd to measure
  The glittering treasure!
    Ah! blesshd to heap up the gold
               Untold
  That flows in a wide
  And deepening tide&mdash;
    Rolled, rolled, rolled
  From multifold sources,
  Converging its courses
    Upon our&mdash;

  LELAND, THE KID:

  Just wait a bit, my pards, I thought I heard
  A sneaking grizzly cracking the dry twigs.
  Such an intrusion might deprive the State
  Of all the good that we intend it. Ha!

  <i>(Enter Sootymug. He saunters carelessly in and gracefully
  leans his back against a redwood.)</i>

  SOOTYMUG:

  My boys, I thought I heard
    Some careless revelry,
  As if your minds were stirred
    By some new devilry.
  I too am in that line. Indeed, the mission
  On which I come&mdash;

  SARALTHIA:

  The red half-moon is dipping to the west,
  And the cold fog invades the sleeping land.
  Lo! how the grinning skulls in the level light
  Litter the place! Methinks that every skull
  Is a most lifelike portrait of my Sen,
  Drawn by the hand of Death; each fleshless pate,
  Cursed with a ghastly grin to eyes unrubbed
  With love's magnetic ointment, seems to mine
  To smile an amiable smile like his
  Whose amiable smile I&mdash;I alone
  Am able to distinguish from his leer!
  See how the gathering coyotes flit
  Through the lit spaces, or with burning eyes
  Star the black shadows with a steadfast gaze!
  About my feet the poddy toads at play,
  Bulbously comfortable, try to hop,
  And tumble clumsily with all their warts;
  While pranking lizards, sliding up and down
  My limbs, as they were public roads, impart
  A singularly interesting chill.
  The circumstance and passion of the time,
  The cast and manner of the place&mdash;the spirit
  Of this confederate environment,
  Command the rights we come to celebrate
  Obedient to the Inspired Hag&mdash;
  The seventh daughter of the seventh daughter,

  <i>(Grimghast by means of a boat-hook stands the coffin on end
  in the excavation; the lid crumbles, exposing the remains of a
  man.)</i>

  Ha! Master Mouldybones, how fare you, sir?

  THE BODY:

  Poorly, I thank your ladyship; I miss
  Some certain fingers and an ear or two.
  There's something, too, gone wrong with my inside,
  And my periphery's not what it was.
  How can we serve each other, you and I?

  NELLIBRAC:

  O what a personable man!

  <i>(Blushes bashfully, drops her eyes and twists the corner of
  her apron</i>.)

  SARALTHIA:

                              Yes, dear,
  A very proper and alluring male,
  And quite superior to Lubin Rroyd,
  Who has, however, this distinct advantage&mdash;
  He is alive.

  GRIMGHAST:

                    Missus, these yer remains
  Was the boss singer back in '72,
  And used to allers git invites to go
  Down to Swellmont and sing at every feed.
  In t'other Villiam's time, that was, afore
  The gent that you've hooked onto bought the place.

  THE BODY <i>(singing):</i>

  Down among the sainted dead
    Many years I lay;
  Beetles occupied my head,
    Moles explored my clay.

  There we feasted day and night&mdash;
    I and bug and beast;
  They provided appetite
    And I supplied the feast.

  The raven is a dicky-bird,

  SARALTHIA <i>(singing):</i>

  The jackal is a daisy,

  NELLIBRAC <i>(singing):</i>

          The wall-mouse is a worthy third,

  A SPOOK <i>(singing):</i>

          But mortals all are crazy.

  CHORUS OF SKULLS:

          O mortals all are crazy,
          Their intellects are hazy;
  In the growing moon they shake their shoon
          And trip it in the mazy.

          But when the moon is waning,
          Their senses they're regaining:
        They fall to prayer and from their hair
          Remove the straws remaining.

  SARALTHIA:

  That's right, Rogues Gallery, pray keep it up:
  Your song recalls my Villiam's "Auld Lang Syne,"
  What time he came and (like an amorous bird
  That struts before the female of its kind,
  Warbling to cave her down the bank) piped high
  His cracked falsetto out of reach. Enough&mdash;
  Now let's to business. Nellibrac, sweet child,
  St. Cloacina's future devotee,
  The time is ripe and rotten&mdash;gut the grip!

  <i>(Nellibrac brings forward a valise and takes from it five
  articles of clothing, which, one by one, she lays upon the points
  of a magic pentagram that has thoughtfully inscribed itself in
  lines of light on the wet grass. The Body holds its late lamented
  nose.)</i>

  NELLIBRAC <i>(singing):</i>

          Fragrant socks, by Villiam's toes
          Consecrated to the nose;

          Shirt that shows the well worn track
          Of the knuckles of his back,

          Handkerchief with mottled stains,
          Into which he blew his brains;

          Collar crying out for soap&mdash;
          Prophet of the future rope;

          An unmentionable thing
          It would sicken me to sing.

  UNMENTIONABLE THING <i>(aside):</i>

  What! <i>I</i> unmentionable? Just you wait!
  In all the family journals of the State
  You'll sometime see that I'm described at length,
  With supereditorial grace and strength.

  SARALTHIA <i>(singing):</i>

          Throw them in the open tomb
          They will cause his love to bloom
          With an amatory boom!

  CHORUS OF INVISIBLE HOODOOS:

          Hoodoo, hoodoo, voudou-vet
          Villiam struggles in the net!
          By the power and intent
          Of the charm his strength is spent!
          By the virtue in each rag
          Blessed by the Inspired Hag
          He will be a willing victim
          Limp as if a donkey kicked him!
          By this awful incantation
          We decree his animation&mdash;

          By the magic of our art
          Warm the cockles of his heart,
          Villiam, if alive or dead,
          Thou Saralthia shalt wed!

  <i>(They cast the garments into the grave and push over the
  coffin. Grimghast fills up the hole. Hoodoos gradually become
  apparent in a phosphorescent light about the grave, holding one
  another's back-hair and dancing in a circle.)</i>

  HOODOO SONG AND DANCE:

    O we're the larrikin hoodoos!
    The chirruping, lirruping hoodoos!
    We mix things up that the Fates ordain,
    Bring back the past and the present detain,
    Postpone the future and sometimes tether
    The three and drive them abreast together&mdash;
    We rollicking, frolicking hoodoos!

    To us all things are the same as none
    And nothing is that is under the sun.
    Seven's a dozen and never is then,
    Whether is what and what is when,
    A man is a tree and a cuckoo a cow
    For gold galore and silver enow
    To magical, mystical hoodoos!

  SARALTHIA:

  What monstrous shadow darkens all the place,

                           <i>(Enter Smyler.)</i>

  Flung like a doom athwart&mdash;ha!&mdash;thou?
  Portentous presence, art thou not the same
  That stalks with aspect horrible among
  Small youths and maidens, baring snaggy teeth,
  Champing their tender limbs till crimson spume,
  Flung from, thy lips in cursing God and man,
  Incarnadines the land?

  SMYLER:

                         Thou dammid slut!

                                <i>(Exit Smyler.)</i>

  NELLIBRAC:

  O what a pretty man!

  SARALTHIA

                       Now who is next?
  Of tramps and casuals this graveyard seems
  Prolific to a fault!

  <i>(Enter Needleson, exhaling, prophetically, an odor of decayed
  eggs and, actually, one of unlaundried linen. He darts an
  intense regard at an adjacent marble angel and places his open
  hand behind his ear.)</i>

  NEEDLESON:

                       Hay?
                                 <i>(Exit Needleson.)</i>

  NELLIBRAC:

                            Sweet, sweet male!
  I yearn to play at Copenhagen with him!

                      <i>(Blushes diligently and energetically.)</i>

  CHORUS OF SKULLS:

        Hoodoos, hoodoos, disappear&mdash;
        Some dread deity draws near!

                                 <i>(Exeunt Hoodos.)</i>

        Smitten with a sense of doom,
        The dead are cowering in the tomb,
        Seas are calling, stars are falling
        And appalling is the gloom!
        Fragmentary flames are flung
        Through the air the trees among!
        Lo! each hill inclines its head&mdash;
        Earth is bending 'neath his thread!

  <i>(On the contrary, enter Villiam on a chip, navigating an
  odor of mignonette. Saralthia springs forward to put him in
  her pocket, but he is instantly retracted by an invisible string.
  She falls headlong, breaking her heart. Reknter Villiam,
  Needleson, Smyler. All gather about Saralthia, who loudly
  laments her accident. The Spirit of Tar-and Feathers, rising
  like a black smoke in their midst, executes a monstrous wink of
  graphic and vivid significance, then contemplates them with an
  obviously baptismal intention. The cross on Lone Mountain
  takes fire, splendoring the Peninsula. Tableau. Curtain.)</i>

<h2>
  THE PASSING SHOW.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
I.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
I know not if it was a dream. I viewed
A city where the restless multitude,
Between the eastern and the western deep
Had roared gigantic fabrics, strong and rude.

Colossal palaces crowned every height;
Towers from valleys climbed into the light;
O'er dwellings at their feet, great golden domes
Hung in the blue, barbarically bright.

But now, new-glimmering to-east, the day
Touched the black masses with a grace of gray,
Dim spires of temples to the nation's God
Studding high spaces of the wide survey.

Well did the roofs their solemn secret keep
Of life and death stayed by the truce of sleep,
Yet whispered of an hour-when sleepers wake,
The fool to hope afresh, the wise to weep.

The gardens greened upon the builded hills
Above the tethered thunders of the mills
With sleeping wheels unstirred to service yet
By the tamed torrents and the quickened rills.

A hewn acclivity, reprieved a space,
Looked on the builder's blocks about his base
And bared his wounded breast in sign to say:
"Strike! 't is my destiny to lodge your race.

"'T was but a breath ago the mammoth browsed
Upon my slopes, and in my caves I housed
Your shaggy fathers in their nakedness,
While on their foeman's offal they caroused."

Ships from afar afforested the bay.
Within their huge and chambered bodies lay
The wealth of continents; and merrily sailed
The hardy argosies to far Cathay.

Beside the city of the living spread&mdash;
Strange fellowship!&mdash;the city of the dead;
And much I wondered what its humble folk,
To see how bravely they were housed, had said.

Noting how firm their habitations stood,
Broad-based and free of perishable wood&mdash;
How deep in granite and how high in brass
The names were wrought of eminent and good,

I said: "When gold or power is their aim,
The smile of beauty or the wage of shame,
Men dwell in cities; to this place they fare
When they would conquer an abiding fame."

From the red East the sun&mdash;a solemn rite&mdash;
Crowned with a flame the cross upon a height
Above the dead; and then with all his strength
Struck the great city all aroar with light!
</pre>
<h3>
  II.
</h3>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
I know not if it was a dream. I came
Unto a land where something seemed the same
That I had known as 't were but yesterday,
But what it was I could not rightly name.

It was a strange and melancholy land.
Silent and desolate. On either hand
Lay waters of a sea that seemed as dead,
And dead above it seemed the hills to stand,

Grayed all with age, those lonely hills&mdash;ah me,
How worn and weary they appeared to be!
Between their feet long dusty fissures clove
The plain in aimless windings to the sea.

One hill there was which, parted from the rest,
Stood where the eastern water curved a-west.
Silent and passionless it stood. I thought
I saw a scar upon its giant breast.

The sun with sullen and portentous gleam
Hung like a menace on the sea's extreme;
Nor the dead waters, nor the far, bleak bars
Of cloud were conscious of his failing beam.

It was a dismal and a dreadful sight,
That desert in its cold, uncanny light;
No soul but I alone to mark the fear
And imminence of everlasting night!

All presages and prophecies of doom
Glimmered and babbled in the ghastly gloom,
And in the midst of that accursÃ¨d scene
A wolf sat howling on a broken tomb.

<h2>
  ELIXER VITAE.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Of life's elixir I had writ, when sleep
(Pray Heaven it spared him who the writing read!)
Sealed upon my senses with so deep
A stupefaction that men thought me dead.
The centuries stole by with noiseless tread,
Like spectres in the twilight of my dream;
I saw mankind in dim procession sweep
Through life, oblivion at each extreme.
Meanwhile my beard, like Barbarossa's growing,
Loaded my lap and o'er my knees was flowing.

The generations came with dance and song,
And each observed me curiously there.
Some asked: "Who was he?" Others in the throng
Replied: "A wicked monk who slept at prayer."
Some said I was a saint, and some a bear&mdash;
These all were women. So the young and gay,
Visibly wrinkling as they fared along,
Doddered at last on failing limbs away;
Though some, their footing in my beard entangled,
Fell into its abysses and were strangled.

At last a generation came that walked
More slowly forward to the common tomb,
Then altogether stopped. The women talked
Excitedly; the men, with eyes agloom
Looked darkly on them with a look of doom;
And one cried out: "We are immortal now&mdash;
How need we these?" And a dread figure stalked,
Silent, with gleaming axe and shrouded brow,
And all men cried: "Decapitate the women,
Or soon there'll be no room to stand or swim in!"

So (in my dream) each lovely head was chopped
From its fair shoulders, and but men alone
Were left in all the world. Birth being stopped,
Enough of room remained in every zone,
And Peace ascended Woman's vacant throne.
Thus, life's elixir being found (the quacks
Their bread-and-butter in it gladly sopped)
'Twas made worth having by the headsman's axe.
Seeing which, I gave myself a hearty shaking,
And crumbled all to powder in the waking.

Will Ignorance my knowledge fail to scout,
Not understanding what 'tis all about,
Yet feeling in its light so mean and small
That all his little soul is turned to gall?

What! "Out of danger?" Jealousy disarmed?
Greed from exaction magically charmed?
Ambition stayed from trampling whom it meets,
Like horses fugitive in crowded streets?
The Bigot, with his candle, book and bell,
Tongue-tied, unlunged and paralyzed as well?
The Critic righteously to justice haled,
His own ear to the post securely nailed&mdash;
What most he dreads unable to inflict,
And powerless to hawk the faults he's picked?
The liar choked upon his choicest lie,
And impotent alike to villify
Or flatter for the gold of thrifty men
Who hate his person but employ his pen&mdash;
Who love and loathe, respectively, the dirt
Belonging to his character and shirt?

What! "Out of danger?"&mdash;Nature's minions all,
Like hounds returning to the huntsman's call,
Obedient to the unwelcome note
That stays them from the quarry's bursting throat?&mdash;
Famine and Pestilence and Earthquake dire,
Torrent and Tempest, Lightning, Frost and Fire,
The soulless Tiger and the mindless Snake,
The noxious Insect from the stagnant lake
(Automaton malevolences wrought
Out of the substance of Creative Thought)&mdash;
These from their immemorial prey restrained,
Their fury baffled and their power chained?

I'm safe? Is that what the physician said?
What! "Out of danger?" Then, by Heaven, I'm dead!

<h2>
  AT THE CLOSE OF THE CANVASS.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
'Twas a Venerable Person, whom I met one Sunday morning,
All appareled as a prophet of a melancholy sect;
And in a jeremaid of objurgatory warning
He lifted up his <i>jodel</i> to the following effect:

O ye sanguinary statesmen, intermit your verbal tussles
O ye editors and orators, consent to hear my lay!
And a little while the digital and maxillary muscles
And attend to what a Venerable Person has to say.

Cease your writing, cease your shouting, cease your wild unearthly lying;
Cease to bandy such expressions as are never, never found
In the letter of a lover; cease "exposing" and "replying"&mdash;
Let there be abated fury and a decrement of sound.

For to-morrow will be Monday and the fifth day of November&mdash;
Only day of opportunity before the final rush.
<i>Carpe diem!</i> go conciliate each person who's a member
Of the other party&mdash;do it while you can without a blush.

"Lo! the time is close upon you when the madness of the season
Having howled itself to silence, like a Minnesota 'clone,
Will at last be superseded by the still, small voice of reason,
When the whelpage of your folly you would willingly disown.

"Ah, 'tis mournful to consider what remorses will be thronging,
With a consciousness of having been so ghastly indiscreet,
When by accident untoward two ex-gentlemen belonging
To the opposite political denominations meet!

"Yes, 'tis melancholy, truly, to forecast the fierce, unruly
Supersurging of their blushes, like the flushes upon high
When Aurora Borealis lights her circumpolar palace
And in customary manner sets her banner in the sky.

"Each will think: 'This falsifier knows that I too am a liar.
Curse him for a son of Satan, all unholily compound!
Curse my leader for another! Curse that pelican, my mother!
Would to God that I when little in my victual had been drowned!'"

Then that Venerable Person went away without returning
And, the madness of the season having also taken flight,
All the people soon were blushing like the skies to crimson burning
When Aurora Borealis fires her premises by night.

As sweet as the look of a lover
Saluting the eyes of a maid,
That blossom to blue as the maid
Is ablush to the glances above her,
The sunshine is gilding the glade
And lifting the lark out of shade.

Sing therefore high praises, and therefore
Sing songs that are ancient as gold,
Of Earth in her garments of gold;
Nor ask of their meaning, nor wherefore
They charm as of yore, for behold!
The Earth is as fair as of old.

Sing songs of the pride of the mountains,
And songs of the strength of the seas,
And the fountains that fall to the seas
From the hands of the hills, and the fountains
That shine in the temples of trees,
In valleys of roses and bees.

Sing songs that are dreamy and tender,
Of slender Arabian palms,
And shadows that circle the palms,
Where caravans, veiled from the splendor,
Are kneeling in blossoms and balms,
In islands of infinite calms.

Barbaric, O Man, was thy runing
When mountains were stained as with wine
By the dawning of Time, and as wine
Were the seas, yet its echoes are crooning,
Achant in the gusty pine
And the pulse of the poet's line.

  YORICK.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
Hard by an excavated street one sat
In solitary session on the sand;
And ever and anon he spake and spat
And spake again&mdash;a yellow skull in hand,
To which that retrospective Pioneer
Addressed the few remarks that follow here:

"Who are you? Did you come 'der blains agross,'
Or 'Horn aroundt'? In days o' '49
Did them thar eye-holes see the Southern Cross
From the Antarctic Sea git up an' shine?
Or did you drive a bull team 'all the way
From Pike,' with Mr. Joseph Bowers?&mdash;say!

"Was you in Frisco when the water came
Up to Montgum'ry street? and do you mind
The time when Peters run the faro game&mdash;
Jim Peters from old Mississip&mdash;behind
Wells Fargo's, where he subsequent was bust
By Sandy, as regards both bank and crust?

"I wonder was you here when Casey shot
James King o' William? And did you attend
The neck-tie dance ensuin'? <i>I</i> did not,
But j'ined the rush to Go Creek with my friend
Ed'ard McGowan; for we was resolved
In sech diversions not to be involved.

"Maybe I knowed you; seems to me I've seed
Your face afore. I don't forget a face,
But names I disremember&mdash;I'm that breed
Of owls. I'm talking some'at into space
An' maybe my remarks is too derned free,
Seein' yer name is unbeknown to me.

"Ther' was a time, I reckon, when I knowed
Nigh onto every dern galoot in town.
That was as late as '50. Now she's growed
Surprisin'! Yes, me an' my pardner, Brown,
Was wide acquainted. If ther' was a cuss
We didn't know, the cause was&mdash;he knowed us.

"Maybe you had that claim adjoinin' mine
Up thar in Calaveras. Was it you
To which Long Mary took a mighty shine,
An' throwed squar' off on Jake the Kangaroo?
I guess if she could see ye now she'd take
Her chance o' happiness along o' Jake.

"You ain't so purty now as you was then:
Yer eyes is nothin' but two prospect holes,
An' women which are hitched to better men
Would hardly for sech glances damn their souls,
As Lengthie did. By G&mdash;&mdash;! I <i>hope</i> it's you,

<h2>
  A VISION OF DOOM.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
I stood upon a hill. The setting sun
Was crimson with a curse and a portent,
And scarce his angry ray lit up the land
That lay below, whose lurid gloom appeared
Freaked with a moving mist, which, reeking up
From dim tarns hateful with some horrid ban,
Took shapes forbidden and without a name.
Gigantic night-birds, rising from the reeds
With cries discordant, startled all the air,
And bodiless voices babbled in the gloom&mdash;
The ghosts of blasphemies long ages stilled,
And shrieks of women, and men's curses. All
These visible shapes, and sounds no mortal ear
Had ever heard, some spiritual sense
Interpreted, though brokenly; for I
Was haunted by a consciousness of crime,
Some giant guilt, but whose I knew not. All
These things malign, by sight and sound revealed,
Were sin-begotten; that I knew&mdash;no more&mdash;
And that but dimly, as in dreadful dreams
The sleepy senses babble to the brain
Imperfect witness. As I stood a voice,
But whence it came I knew not, cried aloud
Some words to me in a forgotten tongue,
Yet straight I knew me for a ghost forlorn,
Returned from the illimited inane.
Again, but in a language that I knew,
As in reply to something which in me
Had shaped itself a thought, but found no words,
It spake from the dread mystery about:
"Immortal shadow of a mortal soul
That perished with eternity, attend.
What thou beholdest is as void as thou:
The shadow of a poet's dream&mdash;himself
As thou, his soul as thine, long dead,
But not like thine outlasted by its shade.
His dreams alone survive eternity
As pictures in the unsubstantial void.
Excepting thee and me (and we because
The poet wove us in his thought) remains
Of nature and the universe no part
Or vestige but the poet's dreams. This dread,
Unspeakable land about thy feet, with all
Its desolation and its terrors&mdash;lo!
'T is but a phantom world. So long ago
That God and all the angels since have died
That poet lived&mdash;yourself long dead&mdash;his mind
Filled with the light of a prophetic fire,
And standing by the Western sea, above
The youngest, fairest city in the world,
Named in another tongue than his for one
Ensainted, saw its populous domain
Plague-smitten with a nameless shame. For there
Red-handed murder rioted; and there
The people gathered gold, nor cared to loose
The assassin's fingers from the victim's throat,
But said, each in his vile pursuit engrossed:
'Am I my brother's keeper? Let the Law
Look to the matter.' But the Law did not.
And there, O pitiful! the babe was slain
Within its mother's breast and the same grave
Held babe and mother; and the people smiled,
Still gathering gold, and said: 'The Law, the Law,'
Then the great poet, touched upon the lips
With a live coal from Truth's high altar, raised
His arms to heaven and sang a song of doom&mdash;
Sang of the time to be, when God should lean
Indignant from the Throne and lift his hand,
And that foul city be no more!&mdash;a tale,
A dream, a desolation and a curse!
No vestige of its glory should survive
In fact or memory: its people dead,
Its site forgotten, and its very name
Disputed."

"Was the prophecy fulfilled?"
The sullen disc of the declining sun
Was crimson with a curse and a portent,
And scarce his angry ray lit up the land
That lay below, whose lurid gloom appeared
Freaked with a moving mist, which, reeking up
From dim tarns hateful with a horrid ban,
Took shapes forbidden and without a name.
Gigantic night-birds, rising from the reeds
With cries discordant, startled all the air,
And bodiless voices babbled in the gloom.
But not to me came any voice again;
And, covering my face with thin, dead hands,
I wept, and woke, and cried aloud to God!

  IN DEFENSE.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
You may say, if you please, Johnny Bull, that our girls
Are crazy to marry your dukes and your earls;
But I've heard that the maids of your own little isle
Greet bachelor lords with a favoring smile.

Nay, titles, 'tis said in defense of our fair,
Are popular here because popular there;
And for them our ladies persistently go
Because 'tis exceedingly English, you know.

Whatever the motive, you'll have to confess
The effort's attended with easy success;
And&mdash;pardon the freedom&mdash;'tis thought, over here,
'Tis mortification you mask with a sneer.

It's all very well, sir, your scorn to parade
Of the high nasal twang of the Yankee maid,
But, ah, to my lord when he dares to propose
No sound is so sweet as that "Yes" from the nose.

Our ladies, we grant, walk alone in the street
(Observe, by-the-by, on what delicate feet!)
'Tis a habit they got here at home, where they say
The men from politeness go seldom astray.

Ah, well, if the dukes and the earls and that lot
Can stand it (God succor them if they cannot!)
Your commoners ought to assent, I am sure,
And what they 're not called on to suffer, endure.

"'Tis nothing but money?" "Your nobles are bought?"
As to that, I submit, it is commonly thought
That England's a country not specially free
Of Croesi and (if you'll allow it) Croesae.

You've many a widow and many a girl
With money to purchase a duke or an earl.
'Tis a very remarkable thing, you'll agree,
When goods import buyers from over the sea.

Alas for the woman of Albion's isle!
She may simper; as well as she can she may smile;
She may wear pantalettes and an air of repose&mdash;
But my lord of the future will talk through his nose.

  AN INVOCATION.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
[Read at the Celebration of Independence Day in San
Francisco, in 1888.]
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Goddess of Liberty! O thou
Whose tearless eyes behold the chain,
And look unmoved upon the slain,
Eternal peace upon thy brow,&mdash;

Before thy shrine the races press,
Thy perfect favor to implore&mdash;
The proudest tyrant asks no more,
The ironed anarchist no less.

Thine altar-coals that touch the lips
Of prophets kindle, too, the brand
By Discord flung with wanton hand
Among the houses and the ships.

Upon thy tranquil front the star
Burns bleak and passionless and white,
Its cold inclemency of light
More dreadful than the shadows are.

Thy name we do not here invoke
Our civic rites to sanctify:
Enthroned in thy remoter sky,
Thou heedest not our broken yoke.

Thou carest not for such as we:
Our millions die to serve the still
And secret purpose of thy will.
They perish&mdash;what is that to thee?

The light that fills the patriot's tomb
Is not of thee. The shining crown
Compassionately offered down
To those who falter in the gloom,

And fall, and call upon thy name,
And die desiring&mdash;'tis the sign
Of a diviner love than thine,
Rewarding with a richer fame.

To him alone let freemen cry
Who hears alike the victor's shout,
The song of faith, the moan of doubt,
And bends him from his nearer sky.

God of my country and my race!
So greater than the gods of old&mdash;
So fairer than the prophets told
Who dimly saw and feared thy face,&mdash;

Who didst but half reveal thy will
And gracious ends to their desire,
Behind the dawn's advancing fire
Thy tender day-beam veiling still,&mdash;

To whom the unceasing suns belong,
And cause is one with consequence,&mdash;
To whose divine, inclusive sense
The moan is blended with the song,&mdash;

Whose laws, imperfect and unjust,
Thy just and perfect purpose serve:
The needle, howsoe'er it swerve,
Still warranting the sailor's trust,&mdash;

God, lift thy hand and make us free
To crown the work thou hast designed.
O, strike away the chains that bind
Our souls to one idolatry!

The liberty thy love hath given
We thank thee for. We thank thee for
Our great dead fathers' holy war
Wherein our manacles were riven.

We thank thee for the stronger stroke
Ourselves delivered and incurred
When&mdash;thine incitement half unheard&mdash;
The chains we riveted we broke.

We thank thee that beyond the sea
The people, growing ever wise,
Turn to the west their serious eyes
And dumbly strive to be as we.

As when the sun's returning flame
Upon the Nileside statue shone,
And struck from the enchanted stone
The music of a mighty fame,

Let Man salute the rising day
Of Liberty, but not adore.
'Tis Opportunity&mdash;no more&mdash;
A useful, not a sacred, ray.

It bringeth good, it bringeth ill,
As he possessing shall elect.
He maketh it of none effect
Who walketh not within thy will.

Give thou or more or less, as we
Shall serve the right or serve the wrong.
Confirm our freedom but so long
As we are worthy to be free.

But when (O, distant be the time!)
Majorities in passion draw
Insurgent swords to murder Law,
And all the land is red with crime;

Or&mdash;nearer menace!&mdash;when the band
Of feeble spirits cringe and plead
To the gigantic strength of Greed,
And fawn upon his iron hand;&mdash;

Nay, when the steps to state are worn
In hollows by the feet of thieves,
And Mammon sits among the sheaves
And chuckles while the reapers mourn;

Then stay thy miracle!&mdash;replace
The broken throne, repair the chain,
Restore the interrupted reign
And veil again thy patient face.

Lo! here upon the world's extreme
We stand with lifted arms and dare
By thine eternal name to swear
Our country, which so fair we deem&mdash;

Upon whose hills, a bannered throng,
The spirits of the sun display
Their flashing lances day by day
And hear the sea's pacific song&mdash;

Shall be so ruled in right and grace
That men shall say: "O, drive afield
The lawless eagle from the shield,
And call an angel to the place!"

  A MORNING FANCY.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
I drifted (or I seemed to) in a boat
Upon the surface of a shoreless sea
Whereon no ship nor anything did float,
Save only the frail bark supporting me;
And that&mdash;it was so shadowy&mdash;seemed to be
Almost from out the very vapors wrought
Of the great ocean underneath its keel;
And all that blue profound appeared as naught
But thicker sky, translucent to reveal,
Miles down, whatever through its spaces glided,
Or at the bottom traveled or abided.

Great cities there I saw&mdash;of rich and poor,
The palace and the hovel; mountains, vales,
Forest and field, the desert and the moor,
Tombs of the good and wise who'd lived in jails,
And seas of denser fluid, white with sails
Pushed at by currents moving here and there
And sensible to sight above the flat
Of that opaquer deep. Ah, strange and fair
The nether world that I was gazing at
With beating heart from that exalted level,
And&mdash;lest I founder&mdash;trembling like the devil!

The cities all were populous: men swarmed
In public places&mdash;chattered, laughed and wept;
And savages their shining bodies warmed
At fires in primal woods. The wild beast leapt
Upon its prey and slew it as it slept.
Armies went forth to battle on the plain
So far, far down in that unfathomed deep
The living seemed as silent as the slain,
Nor even the widows could be heard to weep.
One might have thought their shaking was but laughter;
And, truly, most were married shortly after.

Above the wreckage of that silent fray
Strange fishes swam in circles, round and round&mdash;
Black, double-finned; and once a little way
A bubble rose and burst without a sound
And a man tumbled out upon the ground.
Lord! 'twas an eerie thing to drift apace
On that pellucid sea, beneath black skies
And o'er the heads of an undrowning race;
And when I woke I said&mdash;to her surprise
Who came with chocolate, for me to drink it:
"The atmosphere is deeper than you think it."

Doctors taking human lives.
He will see a learned judge
Whose decision will not budge
Till both litigants are fleeced
And his palm is duly greased.
Lawyers he will see who fight
Day by day and night by night;
Never both upon a side,
Though their fees they still divide.
Preachers he will see who teach
That it is divine to preach&mdash;
That they fan a sacred fire
And are worthy of their hire.
He will see a trusted wife

(Pride of some good husband's life)
Enter at a certain door
And&mdash;but he will see no more.
He will see Good Templars reel&mdash;
See a prosecutor steal,
And a father beat his child.
He'll perhaps see Oscar Wilde.

<h2>
  THE TOWN OF DAE.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
<i>Swains and maidens, young and old,
You to me this tale have told.</i>

Where the squalid town of Dae
Irks the comfortable sea,
Spreading webs to gather fish,
As for wealth we set a wish,
Dwelt a king by right divine,
Sprung from Adam's royal line,
Town of Dae by the sea,
Divers kinds of kings there be.

Name nor fame had Picklepip:
Ne'er a soldier nor a ship
Bore his banners in the sun;
Naught knew he of kingly sport,
And he held his royal court
Under an inverted tun.
Love and roses, ages through,
Bloom where cot and trellis stand;
Never yet these blossoms grew&mdash;
Never yet was room for two&mdash;
In a cask upon the strand.

So it happened, as it ought,
That his simple schemes he wrought
Through the lagging summer's day
In a solitary way.
So it happened, as was best,
That he took his nightly rest
With no dreadful incubus
This way eyed and that way tressed,
Featured thus, and thus, and thus,
Lying lead-like on a breast
By cares of State enough oppressed.
Yet in dreams his fancies rude
Claimed a lordly latitude.
Town of Dae by the sea,
Dreamers mate above their state
And waken back to their degree.

Once to cask himself away
He prepared at close of day.
As he tugged with swelling throat
At a most unkingly coat&mdash;
Not to get it off, but on,
For the serving sun was gone&mdash;
Passed a silk-appareled sprite
Toward her castle on the height,
Seized and set the garment right.
Turned the startled Picklepip&mdash;
Splendid crimson cheek and lip!
Turned again to sneak away,

But she bade the villain stay,
Bade him thank her, which he did
With a speech that slipped and slid,
Sprawled and stumbled in its gait
As a dancer tries to skate.
Town of Dae by the sea,
In the face of silk and lace
Rags too bold should never be.

Lady Minnow cocked her head:
"Mister Picklepip," she said,
"Do you ever think to wed?"
Town of Dae by the sea,
No fair lady ever made a
Wicked speech like that to me!

Wretched little Picklepip
Said he hadn't any ship,
Any flocks at his command,
Nor to feed them any land;
Said he never in his life
Owned a mine to keep a wife.
But the guilty stammer so
That his meaning wouldn't flow;
So he thought his aim to reach
By some figurative speech:
Said his Fate had been unkind
Had pursued him from behind
(How the mischief could it else?)

Came upon him unaware,
Caught him by the collar&mdash;there
Gushed the little lady's glee
Like a gush of golden bells:
"Picklepip, why, that is <i>me</i>!"
Town of Dae by the sea,
Grammar's for great scholars&mdash;she
Loved the summer and the lea.

Stupid little Picklepip
Allowed the subtle hint to slip&mdash;
Maundered on about the ship
That he did not chance to own;
Told this grievance o'er and o'er,
Knowing that she knew before;
Told her how he dwelt alone.
Lady Minnow, for reply,
Cut him off with "So do I!"
But she reddened at the fib;
Servitors had she, <i>ad lib.</i>
Town of Dae by the sea,
In her youth who speaks no truth
Ne'er shall young and honest be.

Witless little Picklepip
Manned again his mental ship
And veered her with a sudden shift.
Painted to the lady's thought
How he wrestled and he wrought

Stoutly with the swimming drift
By the kindly river brought
From the mountain to the sea,
Fuel for the town of Dae.
Tedious tale for lady's ear:
From her castle on the height,
She had watched her water-knight
Through the seasons of a year,
Challenge more than met his view
And conquer better than he knew.
Now she shook her pretty pate
And stamped her foot&mdash;'t was growing late:
"Mister Picklepip, when I
Drifting seaward pass you by;
When the waves my forehead kiss
And my tresses float above&mdash;
Dead and drowned for lack of love&mdash;
You'll be sorry, sir, for this!"
And the silly creature cried&mdash;
Feared, perchance, the rising tide.
Town of Dae by the sea,
Madam Adam, when she had 'em,
May have been as bad as she.

<i>Fiat lux!</i> Love's lumination
Fell in floods of revelation!
Blinded brain by world aglare,
Sense of pulses in the air,

Sense of swooning and the beating
Of a voice somewhere repeating
Something indistinctly heard!
And the soul of Picklepip
Sprang upon his trembling lip,
But he spake no further word
Of the wealth he did not own;
In that moment had outgrown
Ship and mine and flock and land&mdash;
Even his cask upon the strand.
Dropped a stricken star to earth,
Type of wealth and worldly worth.
Clomb the moon into the sky,
Type of love's immensity!
Shaking silver seemed the sea,
Throne of God the town of Dae!
Town of Dae by the sea,
From above there cometh love,
Blessing all good souls that be.

  AN ANARCHIST.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
False to his art and to the high command
God laid upon him, Markham's rebel hand
Beats all in vain the harp he touched before:
It yields a jingle and it yields no more.
No more the strings beneath his finger-tips
Sing harmonies divine. No more his lips,
Touched with a living coal from sacred fires,
Lead the sweet chorus of the golden wires.
The voice is raucous and the phrases squeak;
They labor, they complain, they sweat, they reek!
The more the wayward, disobedient song
Errs from the right to celebrate the wrong,
More diligently still the singer strums,
To drown the horrid sound, with all his thumbs.
Gods, what a spectacle! The angels lean
Out of high Heaven to view the sorry scene,
And Israfel, "whose heart-strings are a lute,"
Though now compassion makes their music mute,
Among the weeping company appears,
Pearls in his eyes and cotton in his ears.

<h2>
  AN OFFER OF MARRIAGE.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Once I "dipt into the future far as human eye could see,"
And saw&mdash;it was not Sandow, nor John Sullivan, but she&mdash;
The Emancipated Woman, who was weeping as she ran
Here and there for the discovery of Expurgated Man.
But the sun of Evolution ever rose and ever set,
And that tardiest of mortals hadn't evoluted yet.
Hence the tears that she cascaded, hence the sighs that tore apart
All the tendinous connections of her indurated heart.
Cried Emancipated Woman, as she wearied of the search:
"In Advancing I have left myself distinctly in the lurch!
Seeking still a worthy partner, from the land of brutes and dudes
I have penetrated rashly into manless solitudes.
Now without a mate of any kind where am I?&mdash;that's to say,
Where shall I be to-morrow?&mdash;where exert my rightful sway
And the purifying strength of my emancipated mind?
Can solitude be lifted up, vacuity refined?
Calling, calling from the shadows in the rear of my Advance&mdash;
From the Region of Unprogress in the Dark Domain of Chance&mdash;
Long I heard the Unevolvable beseeching my return
To share the degradation he's reluctant to unlearn.
But I fancy I detected&mdash;though I pray it wasn't that&mdash;
A low reverberation, like an echo in a hat.
So I've held my way regardless, evoluting year by year,
Till I'm what you now behold me&mdash;or would if you were here&mdash;
A condensed Emancipation and a Purifier proud
An Independent Entity appropriately loud!
Independent? Yes, in spirit, but (O, woful, woful state!)
Doomed to premature extinction by privation of a mate&mdash;
To extinction or reversion, for Unexpurgated Man
Still awaits me in the backward if I sicken of the van.
O the horrible dilemma!&mdash;to be odiously linked
With an Undeveloped Species, or become a Type Extinct!"

As Emancipated Woman wailed her sorrow to the air,
Stalking out of desolation came a being strange and rare&mdash;
Plato's Man!&mdash;bipedal, featherless from mandible to rump,
Its wings two quilless flippers and its tail a plumeless stump.
First it scratched and then it clucked, as if in hospitable terms
It invited her to banquet on imaginary worms.
Then it strutted up before her with a lifting of the head,
And in accents of affection and of sympathy it said:
"My estate is some 'at 'umble, but I'm qualified to draw
Near the hymeneal altar and whack up my heart and claw
To Emancipated Anything as walks upon the earth;
And them things is at your service for whatever they are worth.
I'm sure to be congenial, marm, nor e'er deserve a scowl&mdash;
I'm Emancipated Rooster, I am Expurgated Fowl!"

From the future and its wonders I withdrew my gaze, and then
Wrote this wild unfestive prophecy about the Coming Hen.

<h2>
  ON A PROPOSED CREMATORY.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
When a fair bridge is builded o'er the gulf
Between two cities, some ambitious fool,
Hot for distinction, pleads for earliest leave
To push his clumsy feet upon the span,
That men in after years may single him,
Saying: "Behold the fool who first went o'er!"
So be it when, as now the promise is,
Next summer sees the edifice complete
Which some do name a crematorium,
Within the vantage of whose greater maw's
Quicker digestion we shall cheat the worm
And circumvent the handed mole who loves,
With tunnel, adit, drift and roomy stope,
To mine our mortal parts in all their dips
And spurs and angles. Let the fool stand forth
To link his name with this fair enterprise,
As first decarcassed by the flame. And if
With rival greedings for the fiery fame
They push in clamoring multitudes, or if
With unaccustomed modesty they all
Hold off, being something loth to qualify,
Let me select the fittest for the rite.
By heaven! I'll make so warrantable, wise
And excellent censure of their true deserts,
And such a searching canvass of their claims,
That none shall bait the ballot. I'll spread my choice
Upon the main and general of those
Who, moved of holy impulse, pulpit-born,
Protested 'twere a sacrilege to burn
God's gracious images, designed to rot,
And bellowed for the right of way for each
Distempered carrion through the water pipes.
With such a sturdy, boisterous exclaim
They did discharge themselves from their own throats
Against the splintered gates of audience
'Twere wholesomer to take them in at mouth
Than ear. These shall burn first: their ignible
And seasoned substances&mdash;trunks, legs and arms,
Blent indistinguishable in a mass,
Like winter-woven serpents in a pit&mdash;
None vantaged of his fellow-fools in point
Of precedence, and all alive&mdash;shall serve
As fueling to fervor the retort
For after cineration of true men.

  A DEMAND.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
You promised to paint me a picture,
      Dear Mat,
And I was to pay you in rhyme.
Although I am loth to inflict your
Most easy of consciences, I'm
Of opinion that fibbing is awful,
And breaking a contract unlawful,
Indictable, too, as a crime,
      A slight and all that.

If, Lady Unbountiful, any
      Of that
By mortals called pity has part
In your obdurate soul&mdash;if a penny
You care for the health of my heart,
By performing your undertaking
You'll succor that organ from breaking&mdash;
And spare it for some new smart,
      As puss does a rat.

Do you think it is very becoming,
      Dear Mat,
To deny me my rights evermore
And&mdash;bless you! if I begin summing
Your sins they will make a long score!
You never were generous, madam,
If you had been Eve and I Adam
You'd have given me naught but the core,
      And little of that.

Had I been content with a Titian,
      A cat
By Landseer, a meadow by Claude,
No doubt I'd have had your permission
To take it&mdash;by purchase abroad.
But why should I sail o'er the ocean
For Landseers and Claudes? I've a notion
All's bad that the critics belaud.
      I wanted a Mat.

Presumption's a sin, and I suffer
      For that:
But still you <i>did</i> say that sometime,
If I'd pay you enough (here's enougher&mdash;
That's more than enough) of rhyme
You'd paint me a picture. I pay you
Hereby in advance; and I pray you
Condone, while you can, your crime,
      And send me a Mat.

But if you don't do it I warn you,
      Dear Mat,
I'll raise such a clamor and cry
On Parnassus the Muses will scorn you
As mocker of poets and fly
With bitter complaints to Apollo:
"Her spirit is proud, her heart hollow,
Her beauty"&mdash;they'll hardly deny,
      On second thought, <i>that</i>!

<h2>
  THE WEATHER WIGHT.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
The way was long, the hill was steep,
My footing scarcely I could keep.

The night enshrouded me in gloom,
I heard the ocean's distant boom&mdash;

The trampling of the surges vast
Was borne upon the rising blast.

"God help the mariner," I cried,
"Whose ship to-morrow braves the tide!"

Then from the impenetrable dark
A solemn voice made this remark:

"For this locality&mdash;warm, bright;
Barometer unchanged; breeze light."

"Unseen consoler-man," I cried,
"Whoe'er you are, where'er abide,

"Thanks&mdash;but my care is somewhat less
For Jack's, than for my own, distress.

"Could I but find a friendly roof,
Small odds what weather were aloof.

"For he whose comfort is secure
Another's woes can well endure."

"The latch-string's out," the voice replied,
"And so's the door&mdash;jes' step inside."

Then through the darkness I discerned
A hovel, into which I turned.

Groping about beneath its thatch,
I struck my head and then a match.

A candle by that gleam betrayed
Soon lent paraffinaceous aid.

A pallid, bald and thin old man
I saw, who this complaint began:

"Through summer suns and winter snows
I sets observin' of my toes.

"I rambles with increasin' pain
The path of duty, but in vain.

"Rewards and honors pass me by&mdash;
No Congress hears this raven cry!"

Filled with astonishment, I spoke:
"Thou ancient raven, why this croak?

"With observation of your toes
What Congress has to do, Heaven knows!

"And swallow me if e'er I knew
That one could sit and ramble too!"

To answer me that ancient swain
Took up his parable again:

"Through winter snows and summer suns
A Weather Bureau here I runs.

"I calls the turn, and can declare
Jes' when she'll storm and when she'll fair.

"Three times a day I sings out clear
The probs to all which wants to hear.

"Some weather stations run with light
Frivolity is seldom right.

"A scientist from times remote,
In Scienceville my birth is wrote.

"And when I h'ist the 'rainy' sign
Jes' take your clo'es in off the line."

"Not mine, O marvelous old man,
The methods of your art to scan,

"Yet here no instruments there be&mdash;
Nor 'ometer nor 'scope I see.

"Did you (if questions you permit)
At the asylum leave your kit?"

That strange old man with motion rude
Grew to surprising altitude.

"Tools (and sarcazzems too) I scorns&mdash;
I tells the weather by my corns.

"No doors and windows here you see&mdash;
The wind and m'isture enters free.

"No fires nor lights, no wool nor fur
Here falsifies the tempercher.

"My corns unleathered I expose
To feel the rain's foretellin' throes.

"No stockin' from their ears keeps out
The comin' tempest's warnin' shout.

"Sich delicacy some has got
They know next summer's to be hot.

"This here one says (for that he's best):
'Storm center passin' to the west.'

"This feller's vitals is transfixed
With frost for Janawary sixt'.

"One chap jes' now is occy'pied
In fig'rin on next Fridy's tide.

"I've shaved this cuss so thin and true
He'll spot a fog in South Peru.

"Sech are my tools, which ne'er a swell
Observatory can excel.

"By long a-studyin' their throbs
I catches onto all the probs."

Much more, no doubt, he would have said,
But suddenly he turned and fled;

For in mine eye's indignant green
Lay storms that he had not foreseen,

Till all at once, with silent squeals,
His toes "caught on" and told his heels.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
T.A.H.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Yes, he was that, or that, as you prefer&mdash;
Did so and so, though, faith, it wasn't all;
Lived like a fool, or a philosopher.
And had whatever's needful for a fall.
As rough inflections on a planet merge
In the true bend of the gigantic sphere,
Nor mar the perfect circle of its verge,
So in the survey of his worth the small
Asperities of spirit disappear,
Lost in the grander curves of character.
He lately was hit hard: none knew but I
The strength and terror of that ghastly stroke&mdash;
Not even herself. He uttered not a cry,
But set his teeth and made a revelry;
Drank like a devil&mdash;staining sometimes red
The goblet's edge; diced with his conscience; spread,
Like Sisyphus, a feast for Death, and spoke
His welcome in a tongue so long forgot
That even his ancient guest remembered not
What race had cursed him in it. Thus my friend
Still conjugating with each failing sense
The verb "to die" in every mood and tense,
Pursued his awful humor to the end.
When like a stormy dawn the crimson broke
From his white lips he smiled and mutely bled,
And, having meanly lived, is grandly dead.

  MY MONUMENT.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
It is pleasant to think, as I'm watching my ink
A-drying along my paper,
That a monument fine will surely be mine
When death has extinguished my taper.

From each rhyming scribe of the journalist tribe
Purged clean of all sentiments narrow,
A pebble will mark his respect for the stark
Stiff body that's under the barrow.

By fellow-bards thrown, thus stone upon stone
Will make my celebrity deathless.
O, I wish I could think, as I gaze at my ink,
They'd wait till my carcass is breathless.

  FOR A CERTAIN CRITIC.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Let lowly themes engage my humble pen&mdash;
Stupidities of critics, not of men.
Be it mine once more the maunderings to trace
Of the expounders' self-directed race&mdash;
Their wire-drawn fancies, finically fine,
Of diligent vacuity the sign.
Let them in jargon of their trade rehearse
The moral meaning of the random verse
That runs spontaneous from the poet's pen
To be half-blotted by ambitious men
Who hope with his their meaner names to link
By writing o'er it in another ink
The thoughts unreal which they think they think,
Until the mental eye in vain inspects
The hateful palimpsest to find the text.

The lark ascending heavenward, loud and long
Sings to the dawning day his wanton song.
The moaning dove, attentive to the sound,
Its hidden meaning hastens to expound:
Explains its principles, design&mdash;in brief,
Pronounces it a parable of grief!

The bee, just pausing ere he daubs his thigh
With pollen from a hollyhock near by,
Declares he never heard in terms so just
The labor problem thoughtfully discussed!
The browsing ass looks up and clears his whistle
To say: "A monologue upon the thistle!"
Meanwhile the lark, descending, folds his wing
And innocently asks: "What!&mdash;did I sing?"

O literary parasites! who thrive
Upon the fame of better men, derive
Your sustenance by suction, like a leech,
And, for you preach of them, think masters preach,&mdash;
Who find it half is profit, half delight,
To write about what you could never write,&mdash;
Consider, pray, how sharp had been the throes
Of famine and discomfiture in those
You write of if they had been critics, too,
And doomed to write of nothing but of you!

Lo! where the gaping crowd throngs yonder tent,
To see the lion resolutely bent!
The prosing showman who the beast displays
Grows rich and richer daily in its praise.
But how if, to attract the curious yeoman,
The lion owned the show and showed the showman?

  RELIGIOUS PROGRESS.

Every religion is important. When men rise above existing
conditions a new religion comes in, and it is better

</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Professor dear, I think it queer
That all these good religions
('Twixt you and me, some two or three
Are schemes for plucking pigeons)&mdash;

I mean 'tis strange that every change
Our poor minds to unfetter
Entails a new religion&mdash;true
As t' other one, and better.

From each in turn the truth we learn,
That wood or flesh or spirit
May justly boast it rules the roast
Until we cease to fear it.

Nay, once upon a time long gone
Man worshipped Cat and Lizard:
His God he'd find in any kind
Of beast, from a to izzard.

When risen above his early love
Of dirt and blood and slumber,
He pulled down these vain deities,
And made one out of lumber.

"Far better that than even a cat,"
The Howisons all shouted;
"When God is wood religion's good!"
But one poor cynic doubted.

"A timber God&mdash;that's very odd!"
Said Progress, and invented
The simple plan to worship Man,
Who, kindly soul! consented.

But soon our eye we lift asky,
Our vows all unregarded,
And find (at least so says the priest)
The Truth&mdash;and Man's discarded.

Along our line of march recline
Dead gods devoid of feeling;
And thick about each sun-cracked lout
Dried Howisons are kneeling.

<h2>
  CHARLES AND PETER.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Ere Gabriel's note to silence died
All graves of men were gaping wide.

Then Charles A. Dana, of "The Sun,"
Rose slowly from the deepest one.

"The dead in Christ rise first, 't is writ,"
Quoth he&mdash;"ick, bick, ban, doe,&mdash;I'm It!"

(His headstone, footstone, counted slow,
Were "ick" and "bick," he "ban" and "doe":

Of beating Nick the subtle art
Was part of his immortal part.)

Then straight to Heaven he took his flight,
Arriving at the Gates of Light.

There Warden Peter, in the throes
Of sleep, lay roaring in the nose.

"Get up, you sluggard!" Dana cried&mdash;
"I've an engagement there inside."

The Saint arose and scratched his head.
"I recollect your face," he said.

"(And, pardon me, 't is rather hard),
But&mdash;&mdash;" Dana handed him a card.

"Ah, yes, I now remember&mdash;bless
My soul, how dull I am I&mdash;yes, yes,

"We've nothing better here than bliss.
Walk in. But I must tell you this:

"We've rest and comfort, though, and peace."
"H'm&mdash;puddles," Dana said, "for geese.

"Have you in Heaven no Hell?" "Why, no,"
Said Peter, "nor, in truth, below.

"'T is not included in our scheme&mdash;
'T is but a preacher's idle dream."

The great man slowly moved away.
"I'll call," he said, "another day.

"On earth I played it, o'er and o'er,
And Heaven without it were a bore."

"O, stuff!&mdash;come in. You'll make," said Pete,
"A hell where'er you set your feet."

  CONTEMPLATION.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
I muse upon the distant town
In many a dreamy mood.
Above my head the sunbeams crown
The graveyard's giant rood.
The lupin blooms among the tombs.
The quail recalls her brood.

Ah, good it is to sit and trace
The shadow of the cross;
It moves so still from place to place
O'er marble, bronze and moss;
With graves to mark upon its arc
Our time's eternal loss.

And sweet it is to watch the bee
That reve's in the rose,
And sense the fragrance floating free
On every breeze that blows
O'er many a mound, where, safe and sound,
Mine enemies repose.

  BUSINESS.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Two villains of the highest rank
Set out one night to rob a bank.
They found the building, looked it o'er,
Each window noted, tried each door,
Scanned carefully the lidded hole
For minstrels to cascade the coal&mdash;
In short, examined five-and-twenty
Good paths from poverty to plenty.
But all were sealed, they saw full soon,
Against the minions of the moon.
"Enough," said one: "I'm satisfied."
The other, smiling fair and wide,
Said: "I'm as highly pleased as you:
No burglar ever can get through.
Fate surely prospers our design&mdash;
The booty all is yours and mine."
So, full of hope, the following day
To the exchange they took their way
And bought, with manner free and frank,
Some stock of that devoted bank;
And they became, inside the year,
One President and one Cashier.

Their crime I can no further trace&mdash;
The means of safety to embrace,
I overdrew and left the place.

  Lonely fowls
Blinking wonderfully wise,
With our great round eyes&mdash;
Sitting singly in the gloaming and no longer two and two,
As unwilling to be wedded as unpracticed how to woo;
With regard to being mated,

Ungrammatical acerbity: "To who? To who?"

  TO A CENSOR.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"The delay granted by the weakness and good nature of
our judges is responsible for half the murders."&mdash;<i>Daily Newspaper</i>.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Delay responsible? Why, then; my friend,
Impeach Delay and you will make an end.
Thrust vile Delay in jail and let it rot
For doing all the things that it should not.
Put not good-natured judges under bond,
But make Delay in damages respond.
Minos, Aeacus, Rhadamanthus, rolled
Into one pitiless, unsmiling scold&mdash;
Unsparing censor, be your thongs uncurled
To "lash the rascals naked through the world."
The rascals? Nay, Rascality's the thing
Above whose back your knotted scourges sing.
<i>Your</i> satire, truly, like a razor keen,
"Wounds with a touch that's neither felt nor seen;"
For naught that you assail with falchion free
Has either nerves to feel or eyes to see.
Against abstractions evermore you charge
You hack no helmet and you need no targe.
That wickedness is wrong and sin a vice,
That wrong's not right and foulness never nice,
Fearless affirm. All consequences dare:
Smite the offense and the offender spare.
When Ananias and Sapphira lied
Falsehood, had you been there, had surely died.
When money-changers in the Temple sat,
At money-changing you'd have whirled the "cat"
(That John-the-Baptist of the modern pen)
And all the brokers would have cried amen!

Good friend, if any judge deserve your blame
Have you no courage, or has he no name?
Upon his method will you wreak your wrath,
Himself all unmolested in his path?
Fall to! fall to!&mdash;your club no longer draw
To beat the air or flail a man of straw.
Scorn to do justice like the Saxon thrall
Who cuffed the offender's shadow on a wall.
Let rascals in the flesh attest your zeal&mdash;
Knocked on the mazzard or tripped up at heel!

We know that judges are corrupt. We know
That crimes are lively and that laws are slow.
We know that lawyers lie and doctors slay;
That priests and preachers are but birds of pray;
That merchants cheat and journalists for gold
Flatter the vicious while at vice they scold.
'Tis all familiar as the simple lore
That two policemen and two thieves make four.

But since, while some are wicked, some are good,
(As trees may differ though they all are wood)
Names, here and there, to show whose head is hit,
The bad would sentence and the good acquit.
In sparing everybody none you spare:
Rebukes most personal are least unfair.
To fire at random if you still prefer,
And swear at Dog but never kick a cur,
Permit me yet one ultimate appeal
To something that you understand and feel:
Let thrift and vanity your heart persuade&mdash;
You might be read if you would learn your trade.

Good brother cynics (you have doubtless guessed
Not one of you but all are here addressed)
Remember this: the shaft that seeks a heart
Draws all eyes after it; an idle dart
Shot at some shadow flutters o'er the green,
Its flight unheeded and its fall unseen.

<h2>
  THE HESITATING VETERAN.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
When I was young and full of faith
And other fads that youngsters cherish
A cry rose as of one that saith
With unction: "Help me or I perish!"
'Twas heard in all the land, and men
The sound were each to each repeating.
It made my heart beat faster then
Than any heart can now be beating.

For the world is old and the world is gray&mdash;
Grown prudent and, I guess, more witty.
She's cut her wisdom teeth, they say,
And doesn't now go in for Pity.
Besides, the melancholy cry
Was that of one, 'tis now conceded,
Whose plight no one beneath the sky
Felt half so poignantly as he did.

Moreover, he was black. And yet
That sentimental generation
With an austere compassion set
Its face and faith to the occasion.
Then there were hate and strife to spare,
And various hard knocks a-plenty;
And I ('twas more than my true share,
I must confess) took five-and-twenty.

That all is over now&mdash;the reign
Of love and trade stills all dissensions,
And the clear heavens arch again
Above a land of peace and pensions.
The black chap&mdash;at the last we gave
Him everything that he had cried for,
Though many white chaps in the grave
'Twould puzzle to say what they died for.

I hope he's better off&mdash;I trust
That his society and his master's
Are worth the price we paid, and must
Continue paying, in disasters;
But sometimes doubts press thronging round
('Tis mostly when my hurts are aching)
If war for union was a sound
And profitable undertaking.

'Tis said they mean to take away
The Negro's vote for he's unlettered.
'Tis true he sits in darkness day
And night, as formerly, when fettered;
But pray observe&mdash;howe'er he vote
To whatsoever party turning,
He'll be with gentlemen of note
And wealth and consequence and learning.
With Hales and Morgans on each side,
How could a fool through lack of knowledge,
Vote wrong? If learning is no guide
Why ought one to have been in college?
O Son of Day, O Son of Night!
What are your preferences made of?
I know not which of you is right,
Nor which to be the more afraid of.

The world is old and the world is bad,
And creaks and grinds upon its axis;
And man's an ape and the gods are mad!&mdash;
There's nothing sure, not even our taxes.
No mortal man can Truth restore,
Or say where she is to be sought for.
I know what uniform I wore&mdash;
O, that I knew which side I fought for!

Slain as they lay by the secret, slow,
Pitiless hand of an unseen foe,
Two score thousand old soldiers have crossed
The river to join the loved and lost.
In the space of a year their spirits fled,
Silent and white, to the camp of the dead.

One after one, they fall asleep
And the pension agents awake to weep,
And orphaned statesmen are loud in their wail
As the souls flit by on the evening gale.
O Father of Battles, pray give us release
From the horrors of peace, the horrors of peace!

  TO-DAY.

I saw a man who knelt in prayer,
And heard him say:
"I'll lay my inmost spirit bare
    To-day.

"Lord, for to-morrow and its need
I do not pray;
Let me upon my neighbor feed
    To-day.

"Let me my duty duly shirk
And run away
From any form or phase of work
    To-day.

"From Thy commands exempted still
Let me obey
The promptings of my private will
    To-day.

"Let me no word profane, no lie
Unthinking say
If anyone is standing by
    To-day.

"My secret sins and vices grave
Let none betray;
The scoffer's jeers I do not crave
      To-day.

"And if to-day my fortune all
Should ebb away,
Help me on other men's to fall
      To-day.

"So, for to-morrow and its mite
I do not pray;
Just give me everything in sight
      To-day."

I cried: "Amen!" He rose and ran
Like oil away.
I said: "I've seen an honest man

<h2>
  AN ALIBI.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
A famous journalist, who long
Had told the great unheaded throng
Whate'er they thought, by day or night.
Was true as Holy Writ, and right,
Was caught in&mdash;well, on second thought,
It is enough that he was caught,
And being thrown in jail became
The fuel of a public flame.

"<i>Vox populi vox Dei</i>," said
The jailer. Inxling bent his head
Without remark: that motto good
In bold-faced type had always stood
Above the columns where his pen
Had rioted in praise of men
And all they said&mdash;provided he
Was sure they mostly did agree.
Meanwhile a sharp and bitter strife
To take, or save, the culprit's life
Or liberty (which, I suppose,
Was much the same to him) arose
Outside. The journal that his pen
Adorned denounced his crime&mdash;but then
Its editor in secret tried
To have the indictment set aside.
The opposition papers swore
His father was a rogue before,
And all his wife's relations were
Like him and similar to her.
They begged their readers to subscribe
A dollar each to make a bribe
That any Judge would feel was large
Enough to prove the gravest charge&mdash;
Unless, it might be, the defense
Put up superior evidence.
The law's traditional delay
Was all too short: the trial day
Dawned red and menacing. The Judge
Sat on the Bench and wouldn't budge,
And all the motions counsel made
Could not move <i>him</i>&mdash;and there he stayed.
"The case must now proceed," he said,
"While I am just in heart and head,
It happens&mdash;as, indeed, it ought&mdash;
Both sides with equal sums have bought
My favor: I can try the cause
Impartially." (Prolonged applause.)

The prisoner was now arraigned
And said that he was greatly pained
To be suspected&mdash;<i>he</i>, whose pen
Had charged so many other men
With crimes and misdemeanors! "Why,"
He said, a tear in either eye,
"If men who live by crying out
'Stop thief!' are not themselves from doubt
Of their integrity exempt,
Let all forego the vain attempt
To make a reputation! Sir,
I'm innocent, and I demur."
Whereat a thousand voices cried
Amain he manifestly lied&mdash;
<i>Vox populi</i> as loudly roared
As bull by <i>picadores</i> gored,
In his own coin receiving pay
To make a Spanish holiday.

The jury&mdash;twelve good men and true&mdash;
Were then sworn in to see it through,
And each made solemn oath that he
As any babe unborn was free
From prejudice, opinion, thought,
Respectability, brains&mdash;aught
That could disqualify; and some
Explained that they were deaf and dumb.
A better twelve, his Honor said,
Was rare, except among the dead.
The witnesses were called and sworn.
The tales they told made angels mourn,
And the Good Book they'd kissed became
Red with the consciousness of shame.

Whenever one of them approached
The truth, "That witness wasn't coached,
Your Honor!" cried the lawyers both.
"Strike out his testimony," quoth
The learned judge: "This Court denies
Its ear to stories which surprise.
I hold that witnesses exempt
From coaching all are in contempt."
Both Prosecution and Defense
Applauded the judicial sense,
And the spectators all averred
Such wisdom they had never heard:
'Twas plain the prisoner would be
Found guilty in the first degree.
Meanwhile that wight's pale cheek confessed
The nameless terrors in his breast.
He felt remorseful, too, because
He wasn't half they said he was.
"If I'd been such a rogue," he mused
On opportunities unused,
"I might have easily become
As wealthy as Methusalum."
This journalist adorned, alas,
The middle, not the Bible, class.

With equal skill the lawyers' pleas
Attested their divided fees.
Each gave the other one the lie,
Then helped him frame a sharp reply.

Good Lord! it was a bitter fight,
And lasted all the day and night.
When once or oftener the roar
Had silenced the judicial snore
The speaker suffered for the sport
By fining for contempt of court.
Twelve jurors' noses good and true
Unceasing sang the trial through,
And even <i>vox populi</i> was spent
In rattles through a nasal vent.
Clerk, bailiff, constables and all
Heard Morpheus sound the trumpet call
To arms&mdash;his arms&mdash;and all fell in
Save counsel for the Man of Sin.
That thaumaturgist stood and swayed
The wand their faculties obeyed&mdash;
That magic wand which, like a flame.
Leapt, wavered, quivered and became
A wonder-worker&mdash;known among
The ignoble vulgar as a Tongue.

How long, O Lord, how long my verse
Runs on for better or for worse
In meter which o'ermasters me,
Octosyllabically free!&mdash;
A meter which, the poets say,
No power of restraint can stay;&mdash;
A hard-mouthed meter, suited well
To him who, having naught to tell,
Must hold attention as a trout
Is held, by paying out and out
The slender line which else would break
Should one attempt the fish to take.
Thus tavern guides who've naught to show
But some adjacent curio
By devious trails their patrons lead
And make them think 't is far indeed.
Where was I?

      While the lawyer talked
The rogue took up his feet and walked:
While all about him, roaring, slept,
Into the street he calmly stepped.
In very truth, the man who thought
The people's voice from heaven had caught
God's inspiration took a change
Of venue&mdash;it was passing strange!
Straight to his editor he went
And that ingenious person sent
A Negro to impersonate
The fugitive. In adequate
Disguise he took his vacant place
And buried in his arms his face.
When all was done the lawyer stopped
And silence like a bombshell dropped
Upon the Court: judge, jury, all
Within that venerable hall
(Except the deaf and dumb, indeed,
And one or two whom death had freed)
Awoke and tried to look as though
Slumber was all they did not know.

And now that tireless lawyer-man
Took breath, and then again began:
"Your Honor, if you did attend
To what I've urged (my learned friend
Nodded concurrence) to support
The motion I have made, this court
May soon adjourn. With your assent
I've shown abundant precedent
For introducing now, though late,
New evidence to exculpate
My client. So, if you'll allow,
I'll prove an <i>alibi</i>!" "What?&mdash;how?"
Stammered the judge. "Well, yes, I can't
Deny your showing, and I grant
The motion. Do I understand
You undertake to prove&mdash;good land!&mdash;
That when the crime&mdash;you mean to show
Your client wasn't <i>there</i>?" "O, no,
I cannot quite do that, I find:
My <i>alibi's</i> another kind
Of <i>alibi</i>,&mdash;I'll make it clear,
Your Honor, that he isn't <i>here</i>."
The Darky here upreared his head,
Tranquillity affrighted fled
And consternation reigned instead!

Father! whose hard and cruel law
Is part of thy compassion's plan,

For what the prophets say they saw.

Unbidden still the awful slope
Walling us in we climb to gain
Assurance of the shining plain
That faith has certified to hope.

In vain!&mdash;beyond the circling hill
The shadow and the cloud abide.
Subdue the doubt, our spirits guide
To trust the Record and be still.

To trust it loyally as he
Who, heedful of his high design,
Ne'er raised a seeking eye to thine,
But wrought thy will unconsciously,

Disputing not of chance or fate,
Nor questioning of cause or creed;
For anything but duty's deed
Too simply wise, too humbly great.

The cannon syllabled his name;
His shadow shifted o'er the land,
Portentous, as at his command
Successive cities sprang to flame!

He fringed the continent with fire,
The rivers ran in lines of light!
Thy will be done on earth&mdash;if right
Or wrong he cared not to inquire.

His was the heavy hand, and his
The service of the despot blade;
His the soft answer that allayed
War's giant animosities.

Let us have peace: our clouded eyes,
Fill, Father, with another light,
That we may see with clearer sight
Thy servant's soul in Paradise.

<h2>
  THE FOUNTAIN REFILLED.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Of Hans Pietro Shanahan
(Who was a most ingenious man)
The Muse of History records
That he'd get drunk as twenty lords.

He'd get so truly drunk that men
Stood by to marvel at him when
His slow advance along the street
Was but a vain cycloidal feat.

And when 'twas fated that he fall
With a wide geographical sprawl,
They signified assent by sounds
Heard (faintly) at its utmost bounds.

And yet this Mr. Shanahan
(Who was a most ingenious man)
Cast not on wine his thirsty eyes
When it was red or otherwise.

All malt, or spirituous, tope
He loathed as cats dissent from soap;
And cider, if it touched his lip,
Evoked a groan at every sip.

But still, as heretofore explained,
He not infrequently was grained.
(I'm not of those who call it "corned."
Coarse speech I've always duly scorned.)

Though truth to say, and that's but right,
Strong drink (it hath an adder's bite!)
Was what had put him in the mud,
The only kind he used was blood!

Alas, that an immortal soul
Addicted to the flowing bowl,
The emptied flagon should again
Replenish from a neighbor's vein.

But, Mr. Shanahan was so
Constructed, and his taste that low.
Nor more deplorable was he
In kind of thirst than in degree;

For sometimes fifty souls would pay
The debt of nature in a day
To free him from the shame and pain
Of dread Sobriety's misreign.

His native land, proud of its sense
Of his unique inabstinence,
Abated something of its pride
At thought of his unfilled inside.

And some the boldness had to say
'Twere well if he were called away
To slake his thirst forevermore
In oceans of celestial gore.

But Hans Pietro Shanahan
(Who was a most ingenious man)
Knew that his thirst was mortal; so
Remained unsainted here below&mdash;

Unsainted and unsaintly, for
He neither went to glory nor
To abdicate his power deigned
Where, under Providence, he reigned,

But kept his Boss's power accurst
To serve his wild uncommon thirst.
Which now had grown so truly great
It was a drain upon the State.

Soon, soon there came a time, alas!
When he turned down an empty glass&mdash;
All practicable means were vain
His special wassail to obtain.

In vain poor Decimation tried
To furnish forth the needful tide;
And Civil War as vainly shed
Her niggard offering of red.

Poor Shanahan! his thirst increased
Until he wished himself deceased,
Invoked the firearm and the knife,
But could not die to save his life!

He was so dry his own veins made
No answer to the seeking blade;
So parched that when he would have passed
Away he could not breathe his last.

'Twas then, when almost in despair,
(Unlaced his shoon, unkempt his hair)
He saw as in a dream a way
To wet afresh his mortal clay.

Yes, Hans Pietro Shanahan
(Who was a most ingenious man)
Saw freedom, and with joy and pride
"Thalassa! (or Thalatta!)" cried.

Straight to the Aldermen went he,
With many a "pull" and many a fee,
And many a most corrupt "combine"
(The Press for twenty cents a line

Held out and fought him&mdash;O, God, bless
Forevermore the holy Press!)
Till he had franchises complete
For trolley lines on every street!

The cars were builded and, they say,
Were run on rails laid every way&mdash;
Rhomboidal roads, and circular,
And oval&mdash;everywhere a car&mdash;

Square, dodecagonal (in great
Esteem the shape called Figure 8)
And many other kinds of shapes
As various as tails of apes.

No other group of men's abodes
E'er had such odd electric roads,
That winding in and winding out,
Began and ended all about.

No city had, unless in Mars,
That city's wealth of trolley cars.
They ran by day, they flew by night,
And O, the sorry, sorry sight!

And Hans Pietro Shanahan
(Who was a most ingenious man)
Incessantly, the Muse records,
Lay drunk as twenty thousand lords!

Each to his taste: some men prefer to play
At mystery, as others at piquet.
Some sit in mystic meditation; some

Which, proving stuff, he studies all the more;
Another swears that learning is but good

Then writes upon Simplicity so well
That none agree on what he wants to tell,
And future ages will declare his pen
Inspired by gods with messages to men.
To found an ancient order those devote
Their time&mdash;with ritual, regalia, goat,
Blankets for tossing, chairs of little ease
And all the modern inconveniences;
These, saner, frown upon unmeaning rites
And go to church for rational delights.
So all are suited, shallow and profound,

'Twas a serious person with locks of gray
And a figure like a crescent;
His gravity, clearly, had come to stay,
But his smile was evanescent.

He stood and conversed with a neighbor, and
With (likewise) a high falsetto;
And he stabbed his forefinger into his hand
As if it had been a stiletto.

His words, like the notes of a tenor drum,
Came out of his head unblended,
And the wonderful altitude of some
Was exceptionally splendid.

While executing a shake of the head,
With the hand, as it were, of a master,
This agonizing old gentleman said:
"'Twas a truly sad disaster!

"Four hundred and ten longs and shorts in all,
Went down"&mdash;he paused and snuffled.
A single tear was observed to fall,
And the old man's drum was muffled.

"A very calamitous year," he said.
And again his head-piece hoary
He shook, and another pearl he shed,
As if he wept <i>con amore.</i>

"O lacrymose person," I cried, "pray why
Should these failures so affect you?
With speculators in stocks no eye
That's normal would ever connect you."

He focused his orbs upon mine and smiled
In a sinister sort of manner.
"Young man," he said, "your words are wild:
I spoke of the steamship 'Hanner.'

"For she has went down in a howlin' squall,
And my heart is nigh to breakin'&mdash;
Four hundred and ten longs and shorts in all
Will never need undertakin'!

"I'm in the business myself," said he,
"And you've mistook my expression;
For I uses the technical terms, you see,
Employed in my perfession."

That old undertaker has joined the throng
On the other side of the River,
But I'm still unhappy to think I'm a "long,"
And a tape-line makes me shiver.

  A REPLY TO A LETTER.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
O nonsense, parson&mdash;tell me not they thrive
And jubilate who follow your dictation.
The good are the unhappiest lot alive&mdash;
I know they are from careful observation.
If freedom from the terrors of damnation
Lengthens the visage like a telescope,
And lacrymation is a sign of hope,
Then I'll continue, in my dreadful plight,
To tread the dusky paths of sin, and grope
Contentedly without your lantern's light;
And though in many a bog beslubbered quite,
Refuse to flay me with ecclesiastic soap.

You say 'tis a sad world, seeing I'm condemned,
With many a million others of my kidney.
Each continent's Hammed, Japheted and Shemmed
With sinners&mdash;worldlings like Sir Philip Sidney
And scoffers like Voltaire, who thought it bliss
To simulate respect for Genesis&mdash;
Who bent the mental knee as if in prayer,
But mocked at Moses underneath his hair,
And like an angry gander bowed his head to hiss.

Seeing such as these, who die without contrition,
Must go to&mdash;beg your pardon, sir&mdash;perdition,
The sons of light, you tell me, can't be gay,
But count it sin of the sort called omission
The groan to smother or the tear to stay
Or fail to&mdash;what is that they live by?&mdash;pray.
So down they flop, and the whole serious race is
Put by divine compassion on a praying basis.

Well, if you take it so to heart, while yet
Our own hearts are so light with nature's leaven,
You'll weep indeed when we in Hades sweat,
And you look down upon us out of Heaven.
In fancy, lo! I see your wailing shades
Thronging the crystal battlements. Cascades
Of tears spring singing from each golden spout,
Run roaring from the verge with hoarser sound,
Dash downward through the glimmering profound,
Quench the tormenting flame and put the Devil out!

Presumptuous ass! to you no power belongs
To pitchfork me to Heaven upon the prongs
Of a bad pen, whose disobedient sputter,
With less of ink than incoherence fraught
Befits the folly that it tries to utter.
Brains, I observe, as well as tongues, can stutter:
You suffer from impediment of thought.

When next you "point the way to Heaven," take care:
Your fingers all being thumbs, point, Heaven knows where!
Farewell, poor dunce! your letter though I blame,
Bears witness how my anger I can tame:
I've called you everything except your hateful name!

<h2>
  AN UNMERRY CHRISTMAS.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Christmas, you tell me, comes but once a year.
One place it never comes, and that is here.
Here, in these pages no good wishes spring,
No well-worn greetings tediously ring&mdash;
For Christmas greetings are like pots of ore:
The hollower they are they ring the more.
Here shall no holly cast a spiny shade,
Nor mistletoe my solitude invade,
No trinket-laden vegetable come,
No jorum steam with Sheolate of rum.
No shrilling children shall their voices rear.
Hurrah for Christmas without Christmas cheer!

No presents, if you please&mdash;I know too well
What Herbert Spencer, if he didn't tell
(I know not if he did) yet might have told
Of present-giving in the days of old,
When Early Man with gifts propitiated
The chiefs whom most he doubted, feared and hated,
Or tendered them in hope to reap some rude
Advantage from the taker's gratitude.
Since thus the Gift its origin derives
(How much of its first character survives
You know as well as I) my stocking's tied,
My pocket buttoned&mdash;with my soul inside.
I save my money and I save my pride.

Dinner? Yes; thank you&mdash;just a human body
Done to a nutty brown, and a tear toddy
To give me appetite; and as for drink,
About a half a jug of blood, I think,
Will do; for still I love the red, red wine,
Coagulating well, with wrinkles fine
Fretting the satin surface of its flood.
O tope of kings&mdash;divine Falernian&mdash;blood!

Duse take the shouting fowls upon the limb,
The kneeling cattle and the rising hymn!
Has not a pagan rights to be regarded&mdash;
His heart assaulted and his ear bombarded
With sentiments and sounds that good old Pan
Even in his demonium would ban?

No, friends&mdash;no Christmas here, for I have sworn
To keep my heart hard and my knees unworn.
Enough you have of jester, player, priest:
I as the skeleton attend your feast,
In the mad revelry to make a lull
With shaken finger and with bobbing skull.
However you my services may flout,
Philosophy disdain and reason doubt,
I mean to hold in customary state,
My dismal revelry and celebrate
My yearly rite until the crack o' doom,
Ignore the cheerful season's warmth and bloom
And cultivate an oasis of gloom.

Here lies Greer Harrison, a well cracked louse&mdash;
So small a tenant of so big a house!
He joyed in fighting with his eyes (his fist
Prudently pendent from a peaceful wrist)
And loved to loll on the Parnassian mount,
His pen to suck and all his thumbs to count,&mdash;
What poetry he'd written but for lack
Of skill, when he had counted, to count back!
Alas, no more he'll climb the sacred steep
To wake the lyre and put the world to sleep!
To his rapt lip his soul no longer springs
And like a jaybird from a knot-hole sings.
No more the clubmen, pickled with his wine,
Spread wide their ears and hiccough "That's divine!"
The genius of his purse no longer draws
The pleasing thunders of a paid applause.
All silent now, nor sound nor sense remains,
Though riddances of worms improve his brains.
All his no talents to the earth revert,
And Fame concludes the record: "Dirt to dirt!"

  THE FREE TRADER'S LAMENT.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Oft from a trading-boat I purchased spice
And shells and corals, brought for my inspection
From the fair tropics&mdash;paid a Christian price
And was content in my fool's paradise,
Where never had been heard the word "Protection."

'T was my sole island; there I dwelt alone&mdash;
No customs-house, collector nor collection,
But a man came, who, in a pious tone
Condoled with me that I had never known
The manifest advantage of Protection.

So, when the trading-boat arrived one day,
He threw a stink-pot into its mid-section.
The traders paddled for their lives away,
Nor came again into that haunted bay,
The blessed home thereafter of Protection.

Then down he sat, that philanthropic man,
And spat upon some mud of his selection,
And worked it, with his knuckles in a pan,
To shapes of shells and coral things, and span
A thread of song in glory of Protection.

He baked them in the sun. His air devout
Enchanted me. I made a genuflexion:
"God help you, gentle sir," I said. "No doubt,"
He answered gravely, "I'll get on without
Assistance now that we have got Protection."

Thenceforth I bought his wares&mdash;at what a price
For shells and corals of such imperfection!
"Ah, now," said he, "your lot is truly nice."
But still in all that isle there was no spice
To season to my taste that dish, Protection.

<h2>
  SUBTERRANEAN PHANTASIES.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
I died. As meekly in the earth I lay,
With shriveled fingers reverently folded,
The worm&mdash;uncivil engineer!&mdash;my clay
Tunneled industriously, and the mole did.
My body could not dodge them, but my soul did;
For that had flown from this terrestrial ball
And I was rid of it for good and all.

So there I lay, debating what to do&mdash;
What measures might most usefully be taken
To circumvent the subterranean crew
Of anthropophagi and save my bacon.
My fortitude was all this while unshaken,
But any gentleman, of course, protests
Against receiving uninvited guests.

However proud he might be of his meats,
Not even Apicius, nor, I think, Lucullus,
Wasted on tramps his culinary sweets;
"<i>Aut Caesar</i>," say judicious hosts, "<i>aut nullus</i>."
And though when Marcius came unbidden Tullus
Aufidius feasted him because he starved,
Marcius by Tullus afterward was carved.

We feed the hungry, as the book commands
(For men might question else our orthodoxy)
But do not care to see the outstretched hands,
And so we minister to them by proxy.
When Want, in his improper person, knocks he
Finds we're engaged. The graveworm's very fresh
To think we like his presence in the flesh.

So, as I said, I lay in doubt; in all
That underworld no judges could determine
My rights. When Death approaches them they fall,
And falling, naturally soil their ermine.
And still below ground, as above, the vermin
That work by dark and silent methods win
The case&mdash;the burial case that one is in.

Cases at law so slowly get ahead,
Even when the right is visibly unclouded,
That if all men are classed as quick and dead,
The judges all are dead, though some unshrouded.
Pray Jove that when they're actually crowded
On Styx's brink, and Charon rows in sight,
His bark prove worse than Cerberus's bite.

Ah! Cerberus, if you had but begot
A race of three-mouthed dogs for man to nourish
And woman to caress, the muse had not
Lamented the decay of virtues currish,
And triple-hydrophobia now would flourish,
For barking, biting, kissing to employ
Canine repeaters were indeed a joy.

Lord! how we cling to this vile world! Here I,
Whose dust was laid ere I began this carping,
By moles and worms and such familiar fry
Run through and through, am singing still and harping
Of mundane matters&mdash;flatting, too, and sharping.
I hate the Angel of the Sleeping Cup:
So I'm for getting&mdash;and for shutting&mdash;up.

  IN MEMORIAM
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Beauty (they called her) wasn't a maid
Of many things in the world afraid.
She wasn't a maid who turned and fled
At sight of a mouse, alive or dead.
She wasn't a maid a man could "shoo"
By shouting, however abruptly, "Boo!"
She wasn't a maid who'd run and hide
If her face and figure you idly eyed.
She was'nt a maid who'd blush and shake
When asked what part of the fowl she'd take.
(I blush myself to confess she preferred,
And commonly got, the most of the bird.)
She wasn't a maid to simper because
She was asked to sing&mdash;if she ever was.

In short, if the truth must be displayed
<i>In puris</i>&mdash;Beauty wasn't a maid.
Beauty, furry and fine and fat,
Yawny and clawy, sleek and all that,
Was a pampered and spoiled Angora cat!

I loved her well, and I'm proud that she
Wasn't indifferent, quite, to me;
In fact I have sometimes gone so far
(You know, mesdames, how silly men are)
As to think she preferred&mdash;excuse the conceit&mdash;
<i>My</i> legs upon which to sharpen her feet.
Perhaps it shouldn't have gone for much,
But I started and thrilled beneath her touch!

Ah, well, that's ancient history now:
The fingers of Time have touched my brow,
And I hear with never a start to-day
That Beauty has passed from the earth away.
Gone!&mdash;her death-song (it killed her) sung.
Gone!&mdash;her fiddlestrings all unstrung.
Gone to the bliss of a new <i>rÃ©gime</i>
Of turkey smothered in seas of cream;
Of roasted mice (a superior breed,
To science unknown and the coarser need
Of the living cat) cooked by the flame
Of the dainty soul of an erring dame
Who gave to purity all her care,
Neglecting the duty of daily prayer,&mdash;
Crisp, delicate mice, just touched with spice
By the ghost of a breeze from Paradise;
A very digestible sort of mice.

Let scoffers sneer, I propose to hold
That Beauty has mounted the Stair of Gold,
To eat and eat, forever and aye,
On a velvet rug from a golden tray.
But the human spirit&mdash;that is my creed&mdash;
Rots in the ground like a barren seed.
That is my creed, abhorred by Man
But approved by Cat since time began.
Till Death shall kick at me, thundering "Scat!"
I shall hold to that, I shall hold to that.

  THE STATESMEN.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
How blest the land that counts among
Her sons so many good and wise,
To execute great feats of tongue
When troubles rise.

Behold them mounting every stump
Our liberty by speech to guard.
Observe their courage:&mdash;see them jump
And come down hard!

"Walk up, walk up!" each cries aloud,
"And learn from me what you must do
To turn aside the thunder cloud,
The earthquake too.

"Beware the wiles of yonder quack
Who stuffs the ears of all that pass.
I&mdash;I alone can show that black
Is white as grass."

They shout through all the day and break
The silence of the night as well.
They'd make&mdash;I wish they'd <i>go</i> and make&mdash;

A advocates free silver, B
Free trade and C free banking laws.
Free board, clothes, lodging would from me
  Win warm applause.

Lo, D lifts up his voice: "You see

On all alike." More evenly
  No tax at all.

"With paper money" bellows E
"We'll all be rich as lords." No doubt&mdash;
And richest of the lot will be

As many "cures" as addle wits
Who know not what the ailment is!
Meanwhile the patient foams and spits
  Like a gin fizz.

Alas, poor Body Politic,

To be not altogether quick,

You take your exercise in squirms,
Your rest in fainting fits between.
'T is plain that your disorder's worms&mdash;

Worm Capital, Worm Labor dwell
Within your maw and muscle's scope.

God send you convalesce! God send

<h2>
  THE CYNIC'S BEQUEST
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
In that fair city, Ispahan,
There dwelt a problematic man,
Whose angel never was released,
Who never once let out his beast,
But kept, through all the seasons' round,
Silence unbroken and profound.
No Prophecy, with ear applied
To key-hole of the future, tried
Successfully to catch a hint
Of what he'd do nor when begin 't;
As sternly did his past defy
Mild Retrospection's backward eye.
Though all admired his silent ways,
The women loudest were in praise:
For ladies love those men the most
Who never, never, never boast&mdash;
Who ne'er disclose their aims and ends
To naughty, naughty, naughty friends.

Yet, sooth to say, the fame outran
The merit of this doubtful man,
For taciturnity in him,
Though not a mere caprice or whim,
Was not a virtue, such as truth,
High birth, or beauty, wealth or youth.

'Twas known, indeed, throughout the span
Of Ispahan, of Gulistan&mdash;
These utmost limits of the earth
Knew that the man was dumb from birth.

Unto the Sun with deep salaams
The Parsee spreads his morning palms
(A beacon blazing on a height
Warms o'er his piety by night.)
The Moslem deprecates the deed,
Cuts off the head that holds the creed,
Then reverently goes to grass,
Muttering thanks to Balaam's Ass
For faith and learning to refute
Idolatry so dissolute!
But should a maniac dash past,
With straws in beard and hands upcast,
To him (through whom, whene'er inclined
To preach a bit to Madmankind,
The Holy Prophet speaks his mind)
Our True Believer lifts his eyes
Devoutly and his prayer applies;
But next to Solyman the Great
Reveres the idiot's sacred state.
Small wonder then, our worthy mute
Was held in popular repute.
Had he been blind as well as mum,
Been lame as well as blind and dumb,
No bard that ever sang or soared
Could say how he had been adored.
More meagerly endowed, he drew
An homage less prodigious. True,
No soul his praises but did utter&mdash;
All plied him with devotion's butter,
But none had out&mdash;'t was to their credit&mdash;
The proselyting sword to spread it.
I state these truths, exactly why
The reader knows as well as I;
They've nothing in the world to do
With what I hope we're coming to
If Pegasus be good enough
To move when he has stood enough.
Egad! his ribs I would examine
Had I a sharper spur than famine,
Or even with that if 'twould incline
To examine his instead of mine.
Where was I? Ah, that silent man
Who dwelt one time in Ispahan&mdash;
He had a name&mdash;was known to all
As Meerza Solyman Zingall.

There lived afar in Astrabad,
A man the world agreed was mad,
So wickedly he broke his joke
Upon the heads of duller folk,
So miserly, from day to day,
He gathered up and hid away
In vaults obscure and cellars haunted
What many worthy people wanted,
A stingy man!&mdash;the tradesmen's palms
Were spread in vain: "I give no alms
Without inquiry"&mdash;so he'd say,
And beat the needy duns away.
The bastinado did, 'tis true,
Persuade him, now and then, a few
Odd tens of thousands to disburse
To glut the taxman's hungry purse,
But still, so rich he grew, his fear
Was constant that the Shah might hear.
(The Shah had heard it long ago,
And asked the taxman if 'twere so,
Who promptly answered, rather airish,
The man had long been on the parish.)
The more he feared, the more he grew
A cynic and a miser, too,
Until his bitterness and pelf
Made him a terror to himself;
Then, with a razor's neckwise stroke,
He tartly cut his final joke.
So perished, not an hour too soon,
The wicked Muley Ben Maroon.

From Astrabad to Ispahan
At camel speed the rumor ran
That, breaking through tradition hoar,
And throwing all his kinsmen o'er,
The miser'd left his mighty store
Of gold&mdash;his palaces and lands&mdash;
To needy and deserving hands
(Except a penny here and there
To pay the dervishes for prayer.)
'Twas known indeed throughout the span
Of earth, and into Hindostan,
That our beloved mute was the
Residuary legatee.
The people said 'twas very well,
And each man had a tale to tell
Of how he'd had a finger in 't
By dropping many a friendly hint
At Astrabad, you see. But ah,
They feared the news might reach the Shah!
To prove the will the lawyers bore 't
Before the Kadi's awful court,
Who nodded, when he heard it read,
Confirmingly his drowsy head,
Nor thought, his sleepiness so great,
Himself to gobble the estate.
"I give," the dead had writ, "my all
To Meerza Solyman Zingall
Of Ispahan. With this estate
I might quite easily create
Ten thousand ingrates, but I shun
Temptation and create but one,
In whom the whole unthankful crew
The rich man's air that ever drew
To fat their pauper lungs I fire
Vicarious with vain desire!
From foul Ingratitude's base rout
I pick this hapless devil out,
Bestowing on him all my lands,
My treasures, camels, slaves and bands
Of wives&mdash;I give him all this loot,
And throw my blessing in to boot.
Behold, O man, in this bequest
Philanthropy's long wrongs redressed:
To speak me ill that man I dower
With fiercest will who lacks the power.
Allah il Allah! now let him bloat
With rancor till his heart's afloat,
Unable to discharge the wave
Upon his benefactor's grave!"

Forth in their wrath the people came
And swore it was a sin and shame
To trick their blessed mute; and each
Protested, serious of speech,
That though <i>he'd</i> long foreseen the worst
He'd been against it from the first.
By various means they vainly tried
The testament to set aside,
Each ready with his empty purse
To take upon himself the curse;
For <i>they</i> had powers of invective
Enough to make it ineffective.
The ingrates mustered, every man,
And marched in force to Ispahan
(Which had not quite accommodation)
And held a camp of indignation.

The man, this while, who never spoke&mdash;
On whom had fallen this thunder-stroke
Of fortune, gave no feeling vent
Nor dropped a clue to his intent.
Whereas no power to him came
His benefactor to defame,
Some (such a length had slander gone to)
Even whispered that he didn't want to!
But none his secret could divine;
If suffering he made no sign,
Until one night as winter neared
From all his haunts he disappeared&mdash;
Evanished in a doubtful blank
Like little crayfish in a bank,
Their heads retracting for a spell,
And pulling in their holes as well.

All through the land of Gul, the stout
Young Spring is kicking Winter out.
The grass sneaks in upon the scene,
Defacing it with bottle-green.

The stumbling lamb arrives to ply
His restless tail in every eye,
Eats nasty mint to spoil his meat
And make himself unfit to eat.
Madly his throat the bulbul tears&mdash;
In every grove blasphemes and swears
As the immodest rose displays
Her shameless charms a dozen ways.
Lo! now, throughout the utmost span
Of Ispahan&mdash;of Gulistan&mdash;
A big new book's displayed in all
The shops and cumbers every stall.
The price is low&mdash;the dealers say 'tis&mdash;
And the rich are treated to it gratis.
Engraven on its foremost page
These title-words the eye engage:
"The Life of Muley Ben Maroon,
Of Astrabad&mdash;Rogue, Thief, Buffoon
And Miser&mdash;Liver by the Sweat
Of Better Men: A Lamponette
Composed in Rhyme and Written all
By Meerza Solyman Zingall!"

And then she cried in the viewless gloom:

Leapt out of the window, five fathom sheer!

Alas, that lying is such a sin

Jack Doe met Dick Roe, whose wife he loved,
And said: "I will get the best of him."
So pulling a knife from his boot, he shoved
It up to the hilt in the breast of him.

Then he moved that weapon forth and back,
Enlarging the hole he had made with it,
Till the smoking liver fell out, and Jack
Merrily, merrily played with it.

Then he reached within and he seized the slack
Of the lesser bowel, and, traveling
Hither and thither, looked idly back
On that small intestine, raveling.

The wretched Richard, with many a grin
Laid on with exceeding suavity,
Curled up and died, and they ran John in
And charged him with sins of gravity.

The case was tried and a verdict found:
The jury, with great humanity,
Acquitted the prisoner on the ground
Of extemporary insanity.

<h2>
  MR. FINK'S DEBATING DONKEY.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Of a person known as Peters I will humbly crave your leave
An unusual adventure into narrative to weave&mdash;
Mr. William Perry Peters, of the town of Muscatel,
A public educator and an orator as well.
Mr. Peters had a weakness which, 'tis painful to relate,
Was a strong predisposition to the pleasures of debate.
He would foster disputation wheresoever he might be;
In polygonal contention none so happy was as he.
'Twas observable, however, that the exercises ran
Into monologue by Peters, that rhetorical young man.
And the Muscatelian rustics who assisted at the show,
By involuntary silence testified their overthrow&mdash;
Mr. Peters, all unheedful of their silence and their grief,
Still effacing every vestige of erroneous belief.
O, he was a sore affliction to all heretics so bold
As to entertain opinions that he didn't care to hold.

One day&mdash;'t was in pursuance of a pedagogic plan
For the mental elevation of Uncultivated Man&mdash;
Mr. Peters, to his pupils, in dismissing them, explained
That the Friday evening following (unless, indeed, it rained)
Would be signalized by holding in the schoolhouse a debate
Free to all who their opinions might desire to ventilate
On the question, "Which is better, as a serviceable gift,
Speech or hearing, from barbarity the human mind to lift?"
The pupils told their fathers, who, forehanded always, met
At the barroom to discuss it every evening, dry or wet,
They argued it and argued it and spat upon the stove,
And the non-committal "barkeep" on their differences throve.
And I state it as a maxim in a loosish kind of way:
You'll have the more to back your word the less you have to say.
Public interest was lively, but one Ebenezer Fink
Of the Rancho del Jackrabbit, only seemed to sit and think.

On the memorable evening all the men of Muscatel
Came to listen to the logic and the eloquence as well&mdash;
All but William Perry Peters, whose attendance there, I fear.
Was to wreak his ready rhetoric upon the public ear,
And prove (whichever side he took) that hearing wouldn't lift
The human mind as ably as the other, greater gift.
The judges being chosen and the disputants enrolled,
The question he proceeded <i>in extenso</i> to unfold:
"<i>Resolved</i>&mdash;The sense of hearing lifts the mind up out of reach
Of the fogs of error better than the faculty of speech."
This simple proposition he expounded, word by word,
Until they best understood it who least perfectly had heard.
Even the judges comprehended as he ventured to explain&mdash;
The impact of a spit-ball admonishing in vain.
Beginning at a period before Creation's morn,
He had reached the bounds of tolerance and Adam yet unborn.
As down the early centuries of pre-historic time
He tracked important principles and quoted striking rhyme,
And Whisky Bill, prosaic soul! proclaiming him a jay,
Had risen and like an earthquake, "reeled unheededly away,"
And a late lamented cat, when opportunity should serve,
Was preparing to embark upon her parabolic curve,
A noise arose outside&mdash;the door was opened with a bang
And old Ebenezer Fink was heard ejaculating "G'lang!"
Straight into that assembly gravely marched without a wink
An ancient ass&mdash;the property it was of Mr. Fink.
Its ears depressed and beating time to its infestive tread,
Silent through silence moved amain that stately quadruped!
It stopped before the orator, and in the lamplight thrown
Upon its tail they saw that member weighted with a stone.
Then spake old Ebenezer: "Gents, I heern o' this debate
On w'ether v'ice or y'ears is best the mind to elevate.
Now 'yer's a bird ken throw some light uponto that tough theme:
He has 'em both, I'm free to say, oncommonly extreme.
He wa'n't invited for to speak, but he will not refuse
(If t'other gentleman ken wait) to exposay his views."

Ere merriment or anger o'er amazement could prevail;
He cut the string that held the stone on that canary's tail.
Freed from the weight, that member made a gesture of delight,
Then rose until its rigid length was horizontal quite.
With lifted head and level ears along his withers laid,
Jack sighed, refilled his lungs and then&mdash;to put it mildly&mdash;brayed!
He brayed until the stones were stirred in circumjacent hills,
And sleeping women rose and fled, in divers kinds of frills.
'T is said that awful bugle-blast&mdash;to make the story brief&mdash;
Wafted William Perry Peters through the window, like a leaf!

Such is the tale. If anything additional occurred
'Tis not set down, though, truly, I remember to have heard
That a gentleman named Peters, now residing at Soquel,
A considerable distance from the town of Muscatel,
Is opposed to education, and to rhetoric, as well.

<h2>
  FAME.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
One thousand years I slept beneath the sod,
My sleep in 1901 beginning,
Then, by the action of some scurvy god
Who happened then to recollect my sinning,
I was revived and given another inning.
On breaking from my grave I saw a crowd&mdash;
A formless multitude of men and women,
Gathered about a ruin. Clamors loud
I heard, and curses deep enough to swim in;
And, pointing at me, one said: "Let's put <i>him</i> in."
Then each turned on me with an evil look,
As in my ragged shroud I stood and shook.

"Nay, good Posterity," I cried, "forbear!
If that's a jail I fain would be remaining
Outside, for truly I should little care
To catch my death of cold. I'm just regaining
The life lost long ago by my disdaining
To take precautions against draughts like those
That, haply, penetrate that cracked and splitting
Old structure." Then an aged wight arose
From a chair of state in which he had been sitting,
And with preliminary coughing, spitting
And wheezing, said: "'T is not a jail, we're sure,
Whate'er it may have been when it was newer.

"'T was found two centuries ago, o'ergrown
With brush and ivy, all undoored, ungated;
And in restoring it we found a stone
Set here and there in the dilapidated
And crumbling frieze, inscribed, in antiquated
Big characters, with certain uncouth names,
Which we conclude were borne of old by awful
Rapscallions guilty of all sinful games&mdash;
Vagrants engaged in purposes unlawful,
And orators less sensible than jawful.
So each ten years we add to the long row
A name, the most unworthy that we know."

"But why," I asked, "put <i>me</i> in?" He replied:
"You look it"&mdash;and the judgment pained me greatly;
Right gladly would I then and there have died,
But that I'd risen from the grave so lately.
But on examining that solemn, stately
Old ruin I remarked: "My friend, you err&mdash;
The truth of this is just what I expected.
This building in its time made quite a stir.
I lived (was famous, too) when 't was erected.
The names here first inscribed were much respected.
This is the Hall of Fame, or I'm a stork,
And this goat pasture once was called New York."

  FATE.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Alas, alas, for the tourist's guide!&mdash;
He turned from the beaten trail aside,
Wandered bewildered, lay down and died.

O grim is the Irony of Fate:
It switches the man of low estate
And loosens the dogs upon the great.

It lights the fireman to roast the cook;
The fisherman squirms upon the hook,
And the flirt is slain with a tender look.

The undertaker it overtakes;
It saddles the cavalier, and makes
The haughtiest butcher into steaks.

Assist me, gods, to balk the decree!
Nothing I'll do and nothing I'll be,
In order that nothing be done to me.

  PHILOSOPHER BIMM.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Republicans think Jonas Bimm
A Democrat gone mad,
And Democrats consider him
Republican and bad.

The Tough reviles him as a Dude
And gives it him right hot;
The Dude condemns his crassitude
And calls him <i>sans culottes.</i>

Derided as an Anglophile
By Anglophobes, forsooth,
As Anglophobe he feels, the while,
The Anglophilic tooth.

The Churchman calls him Atheist;
The Atheists, rough-shod,
Have ridden o'er him long and hissed
"The wretch believes in God!"

The Saints whom clergymen we call
Would kill him if they could;
The Sinners (scientists and all)
Complain that he is good.

All men deplore the difference
Between themselves and him,
And all devise expedients
For paining Jonas Bimm.

I too, with wild demoniac glee,
Would put out both his eyes;
For Mr. Bimm appears to me
Insufferably wise!

<h2>
  REMINDED.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Beneath my window twilight made
Familiar mysteries of shade.
Faint voices from the darkening down
Were calling vaguely to the town.
Intent upon a low, far gleam
That burned upon the world's extreme,
I sat, with short reprieve from grief,
And turned the volume, leaf by leaf,
Wherein a hand, long dead, had wrought
A million miracles of thought.
My fingers carelessly unclung
The lettered pages, and among
Them wandered witless, nor divined
The wealth in which, poor fools, they mined.
The soul that should have led their quest
Was dreaming in the level west,
Where a tall tower, stark and still,
Uplifted on a distant hill,
Stood lone and passionless to claim
Its guardian star's returning flame.

I know not how my dream was broke,
But suddenly my spirit woke
Filled with a foolish fear to look
Upon the hand that clove the book,
Significantly pointing; next
I bent attentive to the text,
And read&mdash;and as I read grew old&mdash;
The mindless words: "Poor Tom's a-cold!"

Ah me! to what a subtle touch
The brimming cup resigns its clutch
Upon the wine. Dear God, is 't writ
That hearts their overburden bear
Of bitterness though thou permit
The pranks of Chance, alurk in nooks,
And striking coward blows from books,
And dead hands reaching everywhere?

Come, gentlemen&mdash;your gold.
Thanks: welcome to the show.
To hear a story told
In words you do not know.

Now, great Salvini, rise
And thunder through your tears,
Aha! friends, let your eyes
Interpret to your ears.

Gods! 't is a goodly game.
Observe his stride&mdash;how grand!
When legs like his declaim
Who can misunderstand?

See how that arm goes round.
It says, as plain as day:
"I love," "The lost is found,"
"Well met, sir," or, "Away!"

And mark the drawing down
Of brows. How accurate
The language of that frown:
Pain, gentlemen&mdash;or hate.

Those of the critic trade
Swear it is all as clear
As if his tongue were made
To fit an English ear.

Hear that Italian phrase!
Greek to your sense, 't is true;
But shrug, expression, gaze&mdash;
Well, they are Grecian too.

But it is Art! God wot
Its tongue to all is known.
Faith! he to whom 't were not
Would better hold his own.

Shakespeare says act and word
Must match together true.
From what you've seen and heard,
How can you doubt they do?

Enchanting drama! Mark
The crowd "from pit to dome",
One box alone is dark&mdash;
The prompter stays at home.

Stupendous artist! You
Are lord of joy and woe:
We thrill if you say "Boo,"
And thrill if you say "Bo."

  ANOTHER WAY.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
I lay in silence, dead. A woman came
And laid a rose upon my breast and said:
"May God be merciful." She spoke my name,
And added: "It is strange to think him dead.

"He loved me well enough, but 't was his way
To speak it lightly." Then, beneath her breath:
"Besides"&mdash;I knew what further she would say,
But then a footfall broke my dream of death.

To-day the words are mine. I lay the rose
Upon her breast, and speak her name and deem
It strange indeed that she is dead. God knows
I had more pleasure in the other dream.

I hope&mdash;or fear&mdash;I cannot choose the word,

Reason at love's dictation never could.
Blindly to this dilemma so I grope,

Now Satan, envying the Master's power
To make the meat himself could but devour,
Strolled to the place and, standing by the pool,
Exerted all his will to make a fool.
A miracle!&mdash;from out that ancient hole
Rose Morehouse, lacking nothing but a soul.
"To give him that I've not the power divine,"
Said Satan, sadly, "but I'll lend him mine."

And to this day has never got it back.

Descending Bunker's holy hill. With awe
I noted that he shone with sacred light,
Like Moses with the tables of the Law.

One hundred and eleven years? O small
And paltry period compared with all
The tide of centuries that flowed and ebbed
To etch Yosemite's divided wall!

Ah, Liberty, they sing you always young
Whose harps are in your adoration strung
(Each swears you are his countrywoman, too,
And speak no language but his mother tongue).

And truly, lass, although with shout and horn
Man has all-hailed you from creation's morn,
I cannot think you old&mdash;I think, indeed,
You are by twenty centuries unborn.

<h2>
  THE PASSING OF "BOSS" SHEPHERD.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
The sullen church-bell's intermittent moan,
The dirge's melancholy monotone,
The measured march, the drooping flags, attest
A great man's progress to his place of rest.
Along broad avenues himself decreed
To serve his fellow men's disputed need&mdash;
Past parks he raped away from robbers' thrift
And gave to poverty, wherein to lift
Its voice to curse the giver and the gift&mdash;
Past noble structures that he reared for men
To meet in and revile him, tongue and pen,
Draws the long retinue of death to show
The fit credentials of a proper woe.

"Boss" Shepherd, you are dead. Your hand no more
Throws largess to the mobs that ramp and roar
For blood of benefactors who disdain
Their purity of purpose to explain,
Their righteous motive and their scorn of gain.
Your period of dream&mdash;'twas but a breath&mdash;
Is closed in the indifference of death.
Sealed in your silences, to you alike
If hands are lifted to applaud or strike.
No more to your dull, inattentive ear
Praise of to-day than curse of yesteryear.
From the same lips the honied phrases fall
That still are bitter from cascades of gall.
We note the shame; you in your depth of dark
The red-writ testimony cannot mark
On every honest cheek; your senses all
Locked, <i>incommunicado</i>, in your pall,
Know not who sit and blush, who stand and bawl.

"Seven Grecian cities claim great Homer dead,
Through which the living Homer begged his
bread."
So sang, as if the thought had been his own,
An unknown bard, improving on a known.
"Neglected genius!"&mdash;that is sad indeed,
But malice better would ignore than heed,
And Shepherd's soul, we rightly may suspect,
Prayed often for the mercy of neglect
When hardly did he dare to leave his door
Without a guard behind him and before
To save him from the gentlemen that now
In cheap and easy reparation bow
Their corrigible heads above his corse
To counterfeit a grief that's half remorse.

The pageant passes and the exile sleeps,
And well his tongue the solemn secret keeps
Of the great peace he found afar, until,
Death's writ of extradition to fulfill,
They brought him, helpless, from that friendly zone
To be a show and pastime in his own&mdash;
A final opportunity to those
Who fling with equal aim the stone and rose;
That at the living till his soul is freed,
This at the body to conceal the deed!

Lone on his hill he's lying to await
What added honors may befit his state&mdash;
The monument, the statue, or the arch
(Where knaves may come to weep and dupes to march)
Builded by clowns to brutalize the scenes
His genius beautified. To get the means,
His newly good traducers all are dunned
For contributions to the conscience fund.
If each subscribe (and pay) one cent 'twill rear
A structure taller than their tallest ear.

STANLEY.
Noting some great man's composition vile:
A head of wisdom and a heart of guile,
A will to conquer and a soul to dare,
Joined to the manners of a dancing bear,
Fools unaccustomed to the wide survey
Of various Nature's compensating sway,
Untaught to separate the wheat and chaff,
To praise the one and at the other laugh,
Yearn all in vain and impotently seek
Some flawless hero upon whom to wreak
The sycophantic worship of the weak.
Not so the wise, from superstition free,
Who find small pleasure in the bended knee;
Quick to discriminate 'twixt good and bad,
And willing in the king to find the cad&mdash;
No reason seen why genius and conceit,
The power to dazzle and the will to cheat,
The love of daring and the love of gin,
Should not dwell, peaceful, in a single skin.
To such, great Stanley, you're a hero still,
Despite your cradling in a tub for swill.
Your peasant manners can't efface the mark
Of light you drew across the Land of Dark.

In you the extremes of character are wed,
To serve the quick and villify the dead.
Hero and clown! O, man of many sides,
The Muse of Truth adores you and derides,
And sheds, impartial, the revealing ray
Upon your head of gold and feet of clay.

Endeavoring her money to reach;
The crowds right and left, how they sinned&mdash;O,

Ten miles either way they extended

Once on a time, so ancient poets sing,
There reigned in Godknowswhere a certain king.
So great a monarch ne'er before was seen:
He was a hero, even to his queen,
In whose respect he held so high a place
That none was higher,&mdash;nay, not even the ace.
He was so just his Parliament declared
Those subjects happy whom his laws had spared;
So wise that none of the debating throng
Had ever lived to prove him in the wrong;
So good that Crime his anger never feared,
And Beauty boldly plucked him by the beard;
So brave that if his army got a beating
None dared to face him when he was retreating.
This monarch kept a Fool to make his mirth,
And loved him tenderly despite his worth.
Prompted by what caprice I cannot say,
He called the Fool before the throne one day
And to that jester seriously said:
"I'll abdicate, and you shall reign instead,
While I, attired in motley, will make sport
To entertain your Majesty and Court."

'T was done and the Fool governed. He decreed
The time of harvest and the time of seed;
Ordered the rains and made the weather clear,
And had a famine every second year;
Altered the calendar to suit his freak,
Ordaining six whole holidays a week;
Religious creeds and sacred books prepared;
Made war when angry and made peace when scared.
New taxes he inspired; new laws he made;
Drowned those who broke them, who observed them, flayed,
In short, he ruled so well that all who'd not
Been starved, decapitated, hanged or shot
Made the whole country with his praises ring,
Declaring he was every inch a king;
And the High Priest averred 't was very odd
If one so competent were not a god.

Meantime, his master, now in motley clad,
Wore such a visage, woeful, wan and sad,
That some condoled with him as with a brother
Who, having lost a wife, had got another.
Others, mistaking his profession, often
Approached him to be measured for a coffin.
For years this highborn jester never broke
The silence&mdash;he was pondering a joke.
At last, one day, in cap-and-bells arrayed,
He strode into the Council and displayed
A long, bright smile, that glittered in the gloom
Like a gilt epithet within a tomb.
Posing his bauble like a leader's staff,
To give the signal when (and why) to laugh,
He brought it down with peremptory stroke
And simultaneously cracked his joke!

I can't repeat it, friends. I ne'er could school
Myself to quote from any other fool:
A jest, if it were worse than mine, would start
My tears; if better, it would break my heart.
So, if you please, I'll hold you but to state
That royal Jester's melancholy fate.

The insulted nation, so the story goes,
Rose as one man&mdash;the very dead arose,
Springing indignant from the riven tomb,
And babes unborn leapt swearing from the womb!
All to the Council Chamber clamoring went,
By rage distracted and on vengeance bent.
In that vast hall, in due disorder laid,
The tools of legislation were displayed,
And the wild populace, its wrath to sate,
Seized them and heaved them at the Jester's pate.
Mountains of writing paper; pools and seas
Of ink, awaiting, to become decrees,
Royal approval&mdash;and the same in stacks
Lay ready for attachment, backed with wax;
Pens to make laws, erasers to amend them;
With mucilage convenient to extend them;
Scissors for limiting their application,
And acids to repeal all legislation&mdash;
These, flung as missiles till the air was dense,
Were most offensive weapons of offense,
And by their aid the Fool was nigh destroyed.
They ne'er had been so harmlessly employed.
Whelmed underneath a load of legal cap,
His mouth egurgitating ink on tap,
His eyelids mucilaginously sealed,
His fertile head by scissors made to yield
Abundant harvestage of ears, his pelt,
In every wrinkle and on every welt,
Quickset with pencil-points from feet to gills
And thickly studded with a pride of quills,
The royal Jester in the dreadful strife
Was made (in short) an editor for life!

An idle tale, and yet a moral lurks
In this as plainly as in greater works.
I shall not give it birth: one moral here
Would die of loneliness within a year.

<h2>
  A CAREER IN LETTERS.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
When Liberverm resigned the chair
Of This or That in college, where
For two decades he'd gorged his brain
With more than it could well contain,
In order to relieve the stress
He took to writing for the press.
Then Pondronummus said, "I'll help
This mine of talent to devel'p;"
And straightway bought with coin and credit
The <i>Thundergust</i> for him to edit.

The great man seized the pen and ink
And wrote so hard he couldn't think;
Ideas grew beneath his fist
And flew like falcons from his wrist.
His pen shot sparks all kinds of ways
Till all the rivers were ablaze,
And where the coruscations fell
Men uttered words I dare not spell.

Eftsoons with corrugated brow,
Wet towels bound about his pow,
Locked legs and failing appetite,
He thought so hard he couldn't write.
His soaring fancies, chickenwise,
Came home to roost and wouldn't rise.
With dimmer light and milder heat
His goose-quill staggered o'er the sheet,
Then dragged, then stopped; the finish came&mdash;
He couldn't even write his name.
The <i>Thundergust</i> in three short weeks
Had risen, roared, and split its cheeks.
Said Pondronummus, "How unjust!
The storm I raised has laid my dust!"

When, Moneybagger, you have aught
Invested in a vein of thought,
Be sure you've purchased not, instead,
That salted claim, a bookworm's head.

"I beg you to note," said a Man to a Goose,
As he plucked from her bosom the plumage all loose,
"That pillows and cushions of feathers and beds
As warm as maids' hearts and as soft as their heads,
Increase of life's comforts the general sum&mdash;
Which raises the standard of living." "Come, come,"
The Goose said, impatiently, "tell me or cease,
How that is of any advantage to geese."
"What, what!" said the man&mdash;"you are very obtuse!
Consumption no profit to those who produce?
No good to accrue to Supply from a grand
Progressive expansion, all round, of Demand?
Luxurious habits no benefit bring
To those who purvey the luxurious thing?
Consider, I pray you, my friend, how the growth
Of luxury promises&mdash;" "Promises," quoth
The sufferer, "what?&mdash;to what course is it pledged
To pay me for being so often defledged?"
"Accustomed"&mdash;this notion the plucker expressed

"To one kind of luxury, people soon yearn
For others and ever for others in turn;
And the man who to-night on your feathers will rest,

<pre xml:space="preserve">
I reckon that ye never knew,
That dandy slugger, Tom Carew,
He had a touch as light an' free
As that of any honey-bee;
But where it lit there wasn't much
To jestify another touch.
O, what a Sunday-school it was
To watch him puttin' up his paws
An' roominate upon their heft&mdash;
Particular his holy left!
Tom was my style&mdash;that's all I say;
Some others may be equal gay.
What's come of him? Dunno, I'm sure&mdash;
He's dead&mdash;which make his fate obscure.
I only started in to clear
One vital p'int in his career,
Which is to say&mdash;afore he died
He soiled his erming mighty snide.
Ye see he took to politics
And learnt them statesmen-fellers' tricks;
Pulled wires, wore stovepipe hats, used scent,
Just like he was the President;
Went to the Legislator; spoke
Right out agin the British yoke&mdash;
But that was right. He let his hair
Grow long to qualify for Mayor,
An' once or twice he poked his snoot
In Congress like a low galoot!
It had to come&mdash;no gent can hope
To wrastle God agin the rope.
Tom went from bad to wuss. Being dead,
I s'pose it oughtn't to be said,
For sech inikities as flow
From politics ain't fit to know;
But, if you think it's actin' white
To tell it&mdash;Thomas throwed a fight!

  INDUSTRIAL DISCONTENT.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
As time rolled on the whole world came to be
A desolation and a darksome curse;
And some one said: "The changes that you see
In the fair frame of things, from bad to worse,
Are wrought by strikes. The sun withdrew his glimmer
Because the moon assisted with her shimmer.

"Then, when poor Luna, straining very hard,
Doubled her light to serve a darkling world,
He called her 'scab,' and meanly would retard
Her rising: and at last the villain hurled
A heavy beam which knocked her o'er the Lion
Into the nebula of great O'Ryan.

"The planets all had struck some time before,
Demanding what they said were equal rights:
Some pointing out that others had far more
That a fair dividend of satellites.
So all went out&mdash;though those the best provided,
If they had dared, would rather have abided.

"The stars struck too&mdash;I think it was because
The comets had more liberty than they,
And were not bound by any hampering laws,
While <i>they</i> were fixed; and there are those who say
The comets' tresses nettled poor Altair,
An aged orb that hasn't any hair.

"The earth's the only one that isn't in
The movement&mdash;I suppose because she's watched
With horror and disgust how her fair skin
Her pranking parasites have fouled and blotched
With blood and grease in every labor riot,
When seeing any purse or throat to fly at."

"Pan piping on his reeds, the Naiades,
The Sirens singing by the sleepy seas.

"Nay, show me but a Gorgon and I'll dare
To lift mine eyes to her peculiar hair

"(The fatal horrors of her snaky pate,
That stiffen men into a stony state)

"And die&mdash;erecting, as my soul goes hence,
A statue of myself, without expense."

Straight as I spoke I heard the voice of Fate:
"Look up, my lad, the Gorgon sisters wait."

Raising my eyes, I saw Medusa stand,

  CONTENTMENT.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
Sleep fell upon my senses and I dreamed
Long years had circled since my life had fled.
The world was different, and all things seemed
Remote and strange, like noises to the dead.
And one great Voice there was; and something said:
"Posterity is speaking&mdash;rightly deemed
Infallible:" and so I gave attention,
Hoping Posterity my name would mention.

"Illustrious Spirit," said the Voice, "appear!
While we confirm eternally thy fame,
Before our dread tribunal answer, here,
Why do no statues celebrate thy name,
No monuments thy services proclaim?
Why did not thy contemporaries rear
To thee some schoolhouse or memorial college?
It looks almighty queer, you must acknowledge."

Up spake I hotly: "That is where you err!"
But some one thundered in my ear: "You shan't
Be interrupting these proceedings, sir;
The question was addressed to General Grant."
Some other things were spoken which I can't
Distinctly now recall, but I infer,
By certain flushings of my cheeks and forehead,
Posterity's environment is torrid.

Then heard I (this was in a dream, remark)
Another Voice, clear, comfortable, strong,
As Grant's great shade, replying from the dark,
Said in a tone that rang the earth along,
And thrilled the senses of the Judges' throng:
"I'd rather you would question why, in park
And street, my monuments were not erected
Than why they were." Then, waking, I reflected.

<h2>
  THE NEW ENOCH.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Enoch Arden was an able
Seaman; hear of his mishap&mdash;
Not in wild mendacious fable,
As 't was told by t' other chap;

For I hold it is a youthful
Indiscretion to tell lies,
And the writer that is truthful
Has the reader that is wise.

Enoch Arden, able seaman,
On an isle was cast away,
And before he was a freeman
Time had touched him up with gray.

Long he searched the fair horizon,
Seated on a mountain top;
Vessel ne'er he set his eyes on
That would undertake to stop.

Seeing that his sight was growing
Dim and dimmer, day by day,
Enoch said he must be going.
So he rose and went away&mdash;

Went away and so continued
Till he lost his lonely isle:
Mr. Arden was so sinewed
He could row for many a mile.

Compass he had not, nor sextant,
To direct him o'er the sea:
Ere 't was known that he was extant,
At his widow's home was he.

When he saw the hills and hollows
And the streets he could but know,
He gave utterance as follows
To the sentiments below:

"Blast my tarry toplights! (shiver,
Too, my timbers!) but, I say,
W'at a larruk to diskiver,
I have lost me blessid way!

"W'at, alas, would be my bloomin'
Fate if Philip now I see,
Which I lammed?&mdash;or my old 'oman,
Which has frequent basted <i>me</i>?"

Scenes of childhood swam around him
At the thought of such a lot:
In a swoon his Annie found him
And conveyed him to her cot.

'T was the very house, the garden,
Where their honeymoon was passed:
'T was the place where Mrs. Arden
Would have mourned him to the last.

Ah, what grief she'd known without him!
Now what tears of joy she shed!
Enoch Arden looked about him:
"Shanghaied!"&mdash;that was all he said.

  DISAVOWAL.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Two bodies are lying in Phoenix Park,
Grim and bloody and stiff and stark,
And a Land League man with averted eye
Crosses himself as he hurries by.
And he says to his conscience under his breath:
"I have had no hand in this deed of death!"

A Fenian, making a circuit wide
And passing them by on the other side,
Shudders and crosses himself and cries:
"Who says that I did it, he lies, he lies!"

Gingerly stepping across the gore,
Pat Satan comes after the two before,
Makes, in a solemnly comical way,
The sign of the cross and is heard to say:
"O dear, what a terrible sight to see,
For babes like them and a saint like me!"

Hail, peerless Pun! thou last and best,
Most rare and excellent bequest

Thou let'st thy sudden splendor play,
Adorning all where'er it turns,
As the revealing bull's-eye burns,
Of the dim thief, and plays its trick
Upon the lock he means to pick.

Yet sometimes, too, thou dost appear
As boldly as a brigadier
Tricked out with marks and signs, all o'er,
Of rank, brigade, division, corps,
To show by every means he can
An officer is not a man;
Or naked, with a lordly swagger,
Proud as a cur without a wagger,
Who says: "See simple worth prevail&mdash;
All dog, sir&mdash;not a bit of tail!"

  VICE VERSA.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
Down in the state of Maine, the story goes,
A woman, to secure a lapsing pension,
Married a soldier&mdash;though the good Lord knows
That very common act scarce calls for mention.
What makes it worthy to be writ and read&mdash;
The man she married had been nine hours dead!

Now, marrying a corpse is not an act
Familiar to our daily observation,
And so I crave her pardon if the fact
Suggests this interesting speculation:
Should some mischance restore the man to life
Would she be then a widow, or a wife?

Let casuists contest the point; I'm not
Disposed to grapple with so great a matter.
'T would tie my thinker in a double knot
And drive me staring mad as any hatter&mdash;
Though I submit that hatters are, in fact,
Sane, and all other human beings cracked.

Small thought have I of Destiny or Chance;
Luck seems to me the same thing as Intention;
In metaphysics I could ne'er advance,
And think it of the Devil's own invention.
Enough of joy to know though when I wed
I <i>must</i> be married, yet I <i>may</i> be dead.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
The King of Scotland, years and years ago,
Convened his courtiers in a gallant row
And thus addressed them:

        "Gentle sirs, from you
Abundant counsel I have had, and true:
What laws to make to serve the public weal;
What laws of Nature's making to repeal;
What old religion is the only true one,
And what the greater merit of some new one;
What friends of yours my favor have forgot;
Which of your enemies against me plot.
In harvests ample to augment my treasures,
Behold the fruits of your sagacious measures!
The punctual planets, to their periods just,
Attest your wisdom and approve my trust.
Lo! the reward your shining virtues bring:
The grateful placemen bless their useful king!
But while you quaff the nectar of my favor
I mean somewhat to modify its flavor
By just infusing a peculiar dash
Of tonic bitter in the calabash.
And should you, too abstemious, disdain it,
Egad! I'll hold your noses till you drain it!

"You know, you dogs, your master long has felt
A keen distemper in the royal pelt&mdash;
A testy, superficial irritation,
Brought home, I fancy, from some foreign nation.
For this a thousand simples you've prescribed&mdash;
Unguents external, draughts to be imbibed.
You've plundered Scotland of its plants, the seas
You've ravished, and despoiled the Hebrides,
To brew me remedies which, in probation,
Were sovereign only in their application.
In vain, and eke in pain, have I applied
Your flattering unctions to my soul and hide:
Physic and hope have been my daily food&mdash;
I've swallowed treacle by the holy rood!

"Your wisdom, which sufficed to guide the year
And tame the seasons in their mad career,
When set to higher purposes has failed me
And added anguish to the ills that ailed me.
Nor that alone, but each ambitious leech
His rivals' skill has labored to impeach
By hints equivocal in secret speech.
For years, to conquer our respective broils,
We've plied each other with pacific oils.
In vain: your turbulence is unallayed,
My flame unquenched; your rioting unstayed;
My life so wretched from your strife to save it
That death were welcome did I dare to brave it.
With zeal inspired by your intemperate pranks,
My subjects muster in contending ranks.
Those fling their banners to the startled breeze
To champion some royal ointment; these
The standard of some royal purge display
And 'neath that ensign wage a wasteful fray!
Brave tongues are thundering from sea to sea,
Torrents of sweat roll reeking o'er the lea!
My people perish in their martial fear,
And rival bagpipes cleave the royal ear!

"Now, caitiffs, tremble, for this very hour
Your injured sovereign shall assert his power!
Behold this lotion, carefully compound
Of all the poisons you for me have found&mdash;
Of biting washes such as tan the skin,
And drastic drinks to vex the parts within.
What aggravates an ailment will produce&mdash;
I mean to rub you with this dreadful juice!
Divided counsels you no more shall hatch&mdash;
At last you shall unanimously scratch.
Kneel, villains, kneel, and doff your shirts&mdash;God bless us!
They'll seem, when you resume them, robes of Nessus!"

The sovereign ceased, and, sealing what he spoke,
From Arthur's Seat confirming thunders broke.
The conscious culprits, to their fate resigned,
Sank to their knees, all piously inclined.
This act, from high Ben Lomond where she floats,
The thrifty goddess, Caledonia, notes.
Glibly as nimble sixpence, down she tilts
Headlong, and ravishes away their kilts,
Tears off each plaid and all their shirts discloses,
Removes each shirt and their broad backs exposes.
The king advanced&mdash;then cursing fled amain
Dashing the phial to the stony plain
(Where't straight became a fountain brimming o'er,
Whence Father Tweed derives his liquid store)
For lo! already on each back <i>sans</i> stitch
The red sign manual of the Rosy Witch!

Conceal a letter in her glove.

When lion and lamb have together lain down
Spectators cry out, all in chorus;
"The lamb doesn't shrink nor the lion frown&mdash;
A miracle's working before us!"

But 't is patent why Hot-head his wrath holds in,
And Faint-heart her terror and loathing;
For the one's but an ass in a lion's skin,
The other a wolf in sheep's clothing.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
So <i>you're</i> unthankful&mdash;you'll not eat the bird?
You sit about the place all day and gird.
I understand you'll not attend the ball
That's to be given to-night in Pauper Hall.

Why, that is true, precisely as you've heard:
I have no teeth and I will eat no bird.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
Ah! see how good is Providence. Because
Of teeth He has denuded both your jaws
The fowl's made tender; you can overcome it
By suction; or at least&mdash;well, you can gum it,
Attesting thus the dictum of the preachers
That Providence is good to all His creatures&mdash;
Turkeys excepted. Come, ungrateful friend,
If our Thanksgiving dinner you'll attend
You shall say grace&mdash;ask God to bless at least
The soft and liquid portions of the feast.

  PAUPER.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
Without those teeth my speech is rather thick&mdash;
He'll hardly understand Gum Arabic.
No, I'll not dine to-day. As to the ball,
'Tis known to you that I've no legs at all.
I had the gout&mdash;hereditary; so,
As it could not be cornered in my toe
They cut my legs off in the fond belief
That shortening me would make my anguish brief.
Lacking my legs I could not prosecute
With any good advantage a pursuit;
And so, because my father chose to court
Heaven's favor with his ortolans and Port
(Thanksgiving every day!) the Lord supplied
Saws for my legs, an almshouse for my pride
And, once a year, a bird for my inside.
No, I'll not dance&mdash;my light fantastic toe
Took to its heels some twenty years ago.
Some small repairs would be required for putting
My feelings on a saltatory footing.

<i>(Sings)</i>

O the legless man's an unhappy chap&mdash;
<i>Tum-hi, tum-hi, tum-he o'haddy.</i>
The favors o' fortune fall not in his lap&mdash;
<i>Tum-hi, tum-heedle-do hum.</i>
The plums of office avoid his plate
No matter how much he may stump the State&mdash;
  <i>Tum-hi, ho-heeee.</i>
The grass grows never beneath his feet,
But he cannot hope to make both ends meet&mdash;
  <i>Tum-hi.</i>
With a gleeless eye and a somber heart,
He plays the role of his mortal part:
Wholly himself he can never be.
O, a soleless corporation is he!

The chapel bell is calling, thankless friend,
Balls you may not, but church you <i>shall</i>, attend.
Some recognition cannot be denied
To the great mercy that has turned aside
The sword of death from us and let it fall
Upon the people's necks in Montreal;
That spared our city, steeple, roof and dome,
And drowned the Texans out of house and home;
Blessed all our continent with peace, to flood
The Balkan with a cataclysm of blood.
Compared with blessings of so high degree,
Your private woes look mighty small&mdash;to me.

Daughter of God! Audacity divine&mdash;
Of clowns the terror and of brains the sign&mdash;
Not thou the inspirer of the rushing fool,
Not thine of idiots the vocal drool:
Thy bastard sister of the brow of brass,
Presumption, actuates the charging ass.
Sky-born Audacity! of thee who sings
Should strike with freer hand than mine the strings;
The notes should mount on pinions true and strong,
For thou, the subject shouldst sustain the song,
Till angels lean from Heaven, a breathless throng!
Alas! with reeling heads and wavering tails,
They (notes, not angels) drop and the hymn fails;
The minstrel's tender fingers and his thumbs
Are torn to rags upon the lyre he strums.
Have done! the lofty thesis makes demand
For stronger voices and a harder hand:
Night-howling apes to make the notes aspire,
And Poet Riley's fist to slug the rebel wire!

<h2>
  THE GOD'S VIEW-POINT.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Cheeta Raibama Chunder Sen,
The wisest and the best of men,
Betook him to the place where sat
With folded feet upon a mat
Of precious stones beneath a palm,
In sweet and everlasting calm,
That ancient and immortal gent,
The God of Rational Content.
As tranquil and unmoved as Fate,
The deity reposed in state,
With palm to palm and sole to sole,
And beaded breast and beetling jowl,
And belly spread upon his thighs,
And costly diamonds for eyes.
As Chunder Sen approached and knelt
To show the reverence he felt;
Then beat his head upon the sod
To prove his fealty to the god;
And then by gestures signified
The other sentiments inside;
The god's right eye (as Chunder Sen,
The wisest and the best of men,
Half-fancied) grew by just a thought
More narrow than it truly ought.
Yet still that prince of devotees,
Persistent upon bended knees
And elbows bored into the earth,
Declared the god's exceeding worth,
And begged his favor. Then at last,
Within that cavernous and vast
Thoracic space was heard a sound
Like that of water underground&mdash;
A gurgling note that found a vent
At mouth of that Immortal Gent
In such a chuckle as no ear
Had e'er been privileged to hear!

Cheeta Raibama Chunder Sen,
The wisest, greatest, best of men,
Heard with a natural surprise
That mighty midriff improvise.
And greater yet the marvel was
When from between those massive jaws
Fell words to make the views more plain
The god was pleased to entertain:
"Cheeta Raibama Chunder Sen,"
So ran the rede in speech of men&mdash;
"Foremost of mortals in assent
To creed of Rational Content,
Why come you here to impetrate
A blessing on your scurvy pate?
Can you not rationally be
Content without disturbing me?
Can you not take a hint&mdash;a wink&mdash;
Of what of all this rot I think?
Is laughter lost upon you quite,
To check you in your pious rite?
What! know you not we gods protest
That all religion is a jest?
You take me seriously?&mdash;you
About me make a great ado
(When I but wish to be alone)
With attitudes supine and prone,
With genuflexions and with prayers,
And putting on of solemn airs,
To draw my mind from the survey
Of Rational Content away!
Learn once for all, if learn you can,
This truth, significant to man:
A pious person is by odds
The one most hateful to the gods."
Then stretching forth his great right hand,
Which shadowed all that sunny land,
That deity bestowed a touch
Which Chunder Sen not overmuch
Enjoyed&mdash;a touch divine that made
The sufferer hear stars! They played
And sang as on Creation's morn
When spheric harmony was born.

Cheeta Raibama Chunder Sen,
The most astonished man of men,
Fell straight asleep, and when he woke
The deity nor moved nor spoke,
But sat beneath that ancient palm
In sweet and everlasting calm.

  WITH MINE OWN PETARD.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Time was the local poets sang their songs
Beneath their breath in terror of the thongs
I snapped about their shins. Though mild the stroke
Bards, like the conies, are "a feeble folk,"
Fearing all noises but the one they make
Themselves&mdash;at which all other mortals quake.
Now from their cracked and disobedient throats,
Like rats from sewers scampering, their notes
Pour forth to move, where'er the season serves,
If not our legs to dance, at least our nerves;
As once a ram's-horn solo maddened all
The sober-minded stones in Jerich's wall.
A year's exemption from the critic's curse
Mends the bard's courage but impairs his verse.
Thus poolside frogs, when croaking in the night,
Are frayed to silence by a meteor's flight,
Or by the sudden plashing of a stone
From some adjacent cottage garden thrown,
But straight renew the song with double din
Whene'er the light goes out or man goes in.
Shall I with arms unbraced (my casque unlatched,
My falchion pawned, my buckler, too, attached)
Resume the cuishes and the broad cuirass,
Accomplishing my body all in brass,
And arm in battle royal to oppose
A village poet singing through the nose,
Or strolling troubadour his lyre who strums
With clumsy hand whose fingers all are thumbs?
No, let them rhyme; I fought them once before
And stilled their songs&mdash;but, Satan! how they swore!&mdash;
Cuffed them upon the mouth whene'er their throats
They cleared for action with their sweetest notes;
Twisted their ears (they'd oft tormented mine)
And damned them roundly all along the line;
Clubbed the whole crew from the Parnassian slopes,
A wreck of broken heads and broken hopes!
What gained I so? I feathered every curse
Launched at the village bards with lilting verse.
The town approved and christened me (to show its
High admiration) Chief of Local Poets!

  CONSTANCY.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Dull were the days and sober,
The mountains were brown and bare,
For the season was sad October
And a dirge was in the air.

The mated starlings flew over
To the isles of the southern sea.
She wept for her warrior lover&mdash;
Wept and exclaimed: "Ah, me!

"Long years have I mourned my darling
In his battle-bed at rest;
And it's O, to be a starling,
With a mate to share my nest!"

The angels pitied her sorrow,
Restoring her warrior's life;
And he came to her arms on the morrow
To claim her and take her to wife.

An aged lover&mdash;a portly,
Bald lover, a trifle too stiff,
With manners that would have been courtly,
And would have been graceful, if&mdash;

If the angels had only restored him
Without the additional years
That had passed since the enemy bored him
To death with their long, sharp spears.

As it was, he bored her, and she rambled
Away with her father's young groom,
And the old lover smiled as he ambled
Contentedly back to the tomb.

And Arnold sold himself to t' other side,
Stark piled at Bennington his British dead,
And Gates at Camden, Lee at Monmouth, fled?&mdash;
For this that Perry did the foeman fleece,

  A CHALLENGE.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
A bull imprisoned in a stall
Broke boldly the confining wall,
And found himself, when out of bounds,
Within a washerwoman's grounds.
Where, hanging on a line to dry,
A crimson skirt inflamed his eye.
With bellowings that woke the dead,
He bent his formidable head,
With pointed horns and gnarly forehead;
Then, planting firm his shoulders horrid,
Began, with rage made half insane,
To paw the arid earth amain,
Flinging the dust upon his flanks
In desolating clouds and banks,
The while his eyes' uneasy white
Betrayed his doubt what foe the bright
Red tent concealed, perchance, from sight.
The garment, which, all undismayed,
Had never paled a single shade,
Now found a tongue&mdash;a dangling sock,
Left carelessly inside the smock:
"I must insist, my gracious liege,
That you'll be pleased to raise the siege:
My colors I will never strike.
I know your sex&mdash;you're all alike.
Some small experience I've had&mdash;
You're not the first I've driven mad."

  TWO SHOWS.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
The showman (blessing in a thousand shapes!)
Parades a "School of Educated Apes!"
Small education's needed, I opine,
Or native wit, to make a monkey shine;
The brute exhibited has naught to do
But ape the larger apes who come to view&mdash;
The hoodlum with his horrible grimace,
Long upper lip and furtive, shuffling pace,
Significant reminders of the time
When hunters, not policemen, made him climb;
The lady loafer with her draggling "trail,"
That free translation of an ancient tail;
The sand-lot quadrumane in hairy suit,
Whose heels are thumbs perverted by the boot;
The painted actress throwing down the gage
To elder artists of the sylvan stage,
Proving that in the time of Noah's flood
Two ape-skins held her whole profession's blood;
The critic waiting, like a hungry pup,
To write the school&mdash;perhaps to eat it&mdash;up,
As chance or luck occasion may reveal
To earn a dollar or maraud a meal.
To view the school of apes these creatures go,
Unconscious that themselves are half the show.
These, if the simian his course but trim
To copy them as they have copied him,
Will call him "educated." Of a verity
There's much to learn by study of posterity.

  A POET'S HOPE.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
'Twas a weary-looking mortal, and he wandered near the portal
Of the melancholy City of the Discontented Dead.
He was pale and worn exceeding and his manner was unheeding,
As if it could not matter what he did nor what he said.

"Sacred stranger"&mdash;I addressed him with a reverence befitting
The austere, unintermitting, dread solemnity he wore;
'Tis the custom, too, prevailing in that vicinage when hailing
One who possibly may be a person lately "gone before"&mdash;

"Sacred stranger, much I ponder on your evident dejection,
But my carefulest reflection leaves the riddle still unread.
How do you yourself explain your dismal tendency to wander
By the melancholy City of the Discontented Dead?"

Then that solemn person, pausing in the march that he was making,
Roused himself as if awaking, fixed his dull and stony eye
On my countenance and, slowly, like a priest devout and holy,
Chanted in a mournful monotone the following reply:

"O my brother, do not fear it; I'm no disembodied spirit&mdash;
I am Lampton, the Slang Poet, with a price upon my head.
I am watching by this portal for some late lamented mortal
To arise in his disquietude and leave his earthy bed.

"Then I hope to take possession and pull in the earth above me
And, renouncing my profession, ne'er be heard of any more.
For there's not a soul to love me and no living thing respects me,
Which so painfully affects me that I fain would 'go before.'"

Then I felt a deep compassion for the gentleman's dejection,
For privation of affection would refrigerate a frog.
So I said: "If nothing human, and if neither man nor woman
Can appreciate the fashion of your merit&mdash;buy a dog."

When Man and Woman had been made,
All but the disposition,

And somehow gained admission.

The Master rested from his work,

Content to wait till Monday.

"Too bad!" the Woman cried; "Oh, why,
Does slumber not benumb me?
A disposition! Oh, I die
To know if 'twill become me!"

The Adversary said: "No doubt
'Twill be extremely fine, ma'am,
Though sure 'tis long to be without&mdash;

  TWO ROGUES.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Dim, grim, and silent as a ghost,
The sentry occupied his post,
To all the stirrings of the night
Alert of ear and sharp of sight.
A sudden something&mdash;sight or sound,
About, above, or underground,
He knew not what, nor where&mdash;ensued,
Thrilling the sleeping solitude.
The soldier cried: "Halt! Who goes there?"
The answer came: "Death&mdash;in the air."
"Advance, Death&mdash;give the countersign,
Or perish if you cross that line!"
To change his tone Death thought it wise&mdash;
Reminded him they 'd been allies
Against the Russ, the Frank, the Turk,
In many a bloody bit of work.
"In short," said he, "in every weather
We've soldiered, you and I, together."
The sentry would not let him pass.
"Go back," he growled, "you tiresome ass&mdash;
Go back and rest till the next war,
Nor kill by methods all abhor:
Miasma, famine, filth and vice,
With plagues of locusts, plagues of lice,
Foul food, foul water, and foul gases,
Rank exhalations from morasses.
If you employ such low allies
This business you will vulgarize.
Renouncing then the field of fame
To wallow in a waste of shame,
I'll prostitute my strength and lurk
About the country doing work&mdash;
These hands to labor I'll devote,
Nor cut, by Heaven, another throat!"

Great as a giant organ is, whose reeds

When on this mighty instrument He laid
His hand Who fashioned it, our common moan
Was suppliant in its thundering. The tone
Grew more vivacious when the Devil played.

No more those luring harmonies we hear,
And lo! already men forget the sound.

"And he kissed you fair as he held you there,
A willing bird in a serpent's coil!"

The maid looked up from the cinctured cup
Wherein she was crushing the berries red,
Pain and surprise in her honest eyes&mdash;
"It was only one o' those gods," she said.

  PRESENTIMENT.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
With saintly grace and reverent tread,
She walked among the graves with me;
Her every foot-fall seemed to be
A benediction on the dead.

The guardian spirit of the place
She seemed, and I some ghost forlorn
Surprised in the untimely morn
She made with her resplendent face.

Moved by some waywardness of will,
Three paces from the path apart
She stepped and stood&mdash;my prescient heart
Was stricken with a passing chill.

The folk-lore of the years agone
Remembering, I smiled and thought:
"Who shudders suddenly at naught,
His grave is being trod upon."

But now I know that it was more
Than idle fancy. O, my sweet,
I did not think such little feet
Could make a buried heart so sore!

<h2>
  A STUDY IN GRAY.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
I step from the door with a shiver
(This fog is uncommonly cold)
And ask myself: What did I give her?&mdash;
The maiden a trifle gone-old,
With the head of gray hair that was gold.

Ah, well, I suppose 'twas a dollar,
And doubtless the change is correct,
Though it's odd that it seems so much smaller
Than what I'd a right to expect.
But you pay when you dine, I reflect.

So I walk up the street&mdash;'twas a saunter
A score of years back, when I strolled
From this door; and our talk was all banter
Those days when her hair was of gold,
And the sea-fog less searching and cold.

I button my coat (for I'm shaken,
And fevered a trifle, and flushed
With the wine that I ought to have taken,)
Time was, at this coat I'd have blushed,
Though truly, 'tis cleverly brushed.

A score? Why, that isn't so very
Much time to have lost from a life.
There's reason enough to be merry:
I've not fallen down in the strife,
But marched with the drum and the fife.

If Hope, when she lured me and beckoned,
Had pushed at my shoulders instead,
And Fame, on whose favors I reckoned,
Had laureled the worthiest head,
I could garland the years that are dead.

Believe me, I've held my own, mostly
Through all of this wild masquerade;
But somehow the fog is more ghostly
To-night, and the skies are more grayed,
Like the locks of the restaurant maid.

If ever I'd fainted and faltered
I'd fancy this did but appear;
But the climate, I'm certain, has altered&mdash;
Grown colder and more austere
Than it was in that earlier year.

The lights, too, are strangely unsteady,
That lead from the street to the quay.
I think they'll go out&mdash;and I'm ready
To follow. Out there in the sea
The fog-bell is calling to me.

Says Anderson, Theosophist:
"Among the many that exist
     In modern halls,
Some lived in ancient Egypt's clime
And in their childhood saw the prime
     Of Karnak's walls."

Ah, Anderson, if that is true
'T is my conviction, sir, that you
     Are one of those
That once resided by the Nile,
Peer to the sacred Crocodile,
     Heir to his woes.

My judgment is, the holy Cat
Mews through your larynx (and your hat)
     These many years.
Through you the godlike Onion brings
Its melancholy sense of things,
     And moves to tears.

In you the Bull divine again
Bellows and paws the dusty plain,
  To nature true.
I challenge not his ancient hate
But, lowering my knurly pate,
  Lock horns with you.

And though Reincarnation prove
A creed too stubborn to remove,
  And all your school
Of Theosophs I cannot scare&mdash;
All the more earnestly I swear
  That you're a fool.

You'll say that this is mere abuse
Without, in fraying you, a use.
  That's plain to see
With only half an eye. Come, now,
Be fair, be fair,&mdash;consider how
  It eases <i>me</i>!

  MONTEFIORE.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
I saw&mdash;'twas in a dream, the other night&mdash;
A man whose hair with age was thin and white:
One hundred years had bettered by his birth,
And still his step was firm, his eye was bright.

Before him and about him pressed a crowd.
Each head in reverence was bared and bowed,
And Jews and Gentiles in a hundred tongues
Extolled his deeds and spoke his fame aloud.

I joined the throng and, pushing forward, cried,
"Montefiore!" with the rest, and vied
In efforts to caress the hand that ne'er
To want and worth had charity denied.

So closely round him swarmed our shouting clan
He scarce could breathe, and taking from a pan
A gleaming coin he tossed it o'er our heads,
And in a moment was a lonely man!

A-singing all forlorn:

Large eggs are a-ripening on the vine.

"Some there must be to till the soil
And the widow's weeds keep down.
I wasn't cut out for rural toil
But they <i>won't</i> let me live in town!
They 're not so many by two or three,
As they think, but ah! they 're too many for me."

Warbled his wood-note high.
There was blood on his brow and blood in his hair,
But he had no blood in his eye.

<h2>
  TO A PROFESSIONAL EULOGIST.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Newman, in you two parasites combine:
As tapeworm and as graveworm too you shine.
When on the virtues of the quick you've dwelt,
The pride of residence was all you felt
(What vain vulgarian the wish ne'er knew
To paint his lodging a flamboyant hue?)
And when the praises of the dead you've sung,
'Twas appetite, not truth, inspired your tongue;
As ill-bred men when warming to their wine
Boast of its merit though it be but brine.
Nor gratitude incites your song, nor should&mdash;
Even charity would shun you if she could.
You share, 'tis true, the rich man's daily dole,
But what you get you take by way of toll.
Vain to resist you&mdash;vermifuge alone
Has power to push you from your robber throne.
When to escape you he's compelled to die
Hey! presto!&mdash;in the twinkling of an eye
You vanish as a tapeworm, reappear
As graveworm and resume your curst career.
As host no more, to satisfy your need
He serves as dinner your unaltered greed.
O thrifty sycophant of wealth and fame,
Son of servility and priest of shame,
While naught your mad ambition can abate
To lick the spittle of the rich and great;
While still like smoke your eulogies arise
To soot your heroes and inflame our eyes;
While still with holy oil, like that which ran
Down Aaron's beard, you smear each famous man,
I cannot choose but think it very odd
It ne'er occurs to you to fawn on God.

  ELECTION DAY.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
Despots effete upon tottering thrones
Unsteadily poised upon dead men's bones,
Walk up! walk up! the circus is free,
And this wonderful spectacle you shall see:
Millions of voters who mostly are fools&mdash;
Demagogues' dupes and candidates' tools,
Armies of uniformed mountebanks,
And braying disciples of brainless cranks.
Many a week they've bellowed like beeves,
Bitterly blackguarding, lying like thieves,
Libeling freely the quick and the dead
And painting the New Jerusalem red.
Tyrants monarchical&mdash;emperors, kings,
Princes and nobles and all such things&mdash;
Noblemen, gentlemen, step this way:
There's nothing, the Devil excepted, to pay,
And the freaks and curios here to be seen
Are very uncommonly grand and serene.

No more with vivacity they debate,
Nor cheerfully crack the illogical pate;
No longer, the dull understanding to aid,
The stomach accepts the instructive blade,
Nor the stubborn heart learns what is what
From a revelation of rabbit-shot;
And vilification's flames&mdash;behold!
Burn with a bickering faint and cold.

Magnificent spectacle!&mdash;every tongue
Suddenly civil that yesterday rung
(Like a clapper beating a brazen bell)
Each fair reputation's eternal knell;
Hands no longer delivering blows,
And noses, for counting, arrayed in rows.

Walk up, gentlemen&mdash;nothing to pay&mdash;
The Devil goes back to Hell to-day.

Who had sailed the northern-lakes&mdash;
"No woefuler one has ever been told
Exceptin' them called 'fakes.'"

"Go on, thou son of the wind and fog,
For I burn to know the worst!"
But his silent lip in a glass of grog
Was dreamily immersed.

Then he wiped it on his sleeve and said:
"It's never like that I drinks
But what of the gallant gent that's dead
I truly mournful thinks.

"He was a soldier chap&mdash;leastways
As 'Colonel' he was knew;
An' he hailed from some'rs where they raise
A grass that's heavenly blue.

"He sailed as a passenger aboard
The schooner 'Henery Jo.'
O wild the waves and galeses roared,
Like taggers in a show!

"But he sat at table that calm an' mild
As if he never had let
His sperit know that the waves was wild
An' everlastin' wet!&mdash;

"Jest set with a bottle afore his nose,
As was labeled 'Total Eclipse'
(The bottle was) an' he frequent rose
A glass o' the same to his lips.

"An' he says to me (for the steward slick
Of the 'Henery Jo' was I):
'This sailor life's the very old Nick&mdash;
On the lakes it's powerful dry!'

"I says: 'Aye, aye, sir, it beats the Dutch.
I hopes you'll outlast the trip.'
But if I'd been him&mdash;an' I said as much&mdash;
I'd 'a' took a faster ship.

"His laughture, loud an' long an' free,
Rang out o'er the tempest's roar.
'You're an elegant reasoner,' says he,
'But it's powerful dry ashore!'"

"O mariner man, why pause and don
A look of so deep concern?
Have another glass&mdash;go on, go on,
For to know the worst I burn."

"One day he was leanin' over the rail,
When his footing some way slipped,
An' (this is the woefulest part o' my tale),
He was accidental unshipped!

"The empty boats was overboard hove,
As he swum in the 'Henery's wake';
But 'fore we had 'bouted ship he had drove
From sight on the ragin' lake!"

"And so the poor gentleman was drowned&mdash;
And now I'm apprised of the worst."
"What! him? 'Twas an hour afore he was found&mdash;
In the yawl&mdash;stone dead o' thirst!"

<h2>
  A DILEMMA.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Filled with a zeal to serve my fellow men,
For years I criticised their prose and verges:
Pointed out all their blunders of the pen,
Their shallowness of thought and feeling; then
Damned them up hill and down with hearty curses!

They said: "That's all that he can do&mdash;just sneer,
And pull to pieces and be analytic.
Why doesn't he himself, eschewing fear,
Publish a book or two, and so appear
As one who has the right to be a critic?

"Let him who knows it all forbear to tell
How little others know, but show his learning."
The public added: "Who has written well
May censure freely"&mdash;quoting Pope. I fell
Into the trap and books began out-turning,&mdash;

Books by the score&mdash;fine prose and poems fair,
And not a book of them but was a terror,
They were so great and perfect; though I swear
I tried right hard to work in, here and there,
(My nature still forbade) a fault or error.

'Tis true, some wretches, whom I'd scratched, no doubt,
Professed to find&mdash;but that's a trifling matter.
Now, when the flood of noble books was out
I raised o'er all that land a joyous shout,
Till I was thought as mad as any hatter!

(Why hatters all are mad, I cannot say.
'T were wrong in their affliction to revile 'em,
But truly, you'll confess 'tis very sad
We wear the ugly things they make. Begad,
They'd be less mischievous in an asylum!)

"Consistency, thou art a"&mdash;well, you're <i>paste</i>!
When next I felt my demon in possession,
And made the field of authorship a waste,
All said of me:  "What execrable taste,
To rail at others of his own profession!"

Good Lord! where do the critic's rights begin
Who has of literature some clear-cut notion,
And hears a voice from Heaven say: "Pitch in"?
He finds himself&mdash;alas, poor son of sin&mdash;
Between the devil and the deep blue ocean!

<h2>
  THE SAINT AND THE MONK.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Saint Peter at the gate of Heaven displayed
The tools and terrors of his awful trade;
The key, the frown as pitiless as night,
That slays intending trespassers at sight,
And, at his side in easy reach, the curled
Interrogation points all ready to be hurled.

Straight up the shining cloudway (it so chanced
No others were about) a soul advanced&mdash;
A fat, orbicular and jolly soul
With laughter-lines upon each rosy jowl&mdash;
A monk so prepossessing that the saint
Admired him, breathless, until weak and faint,
Forgot his frown and all his questions too,
Forgoing even the customary "Who?"&mdash;
Threw wide the gate and, with a friendly grin,
Said, "'Tis a very humble home, but pray walk in."

The soul smiled pleasantly. "Excuse me, please&mdash;
Who's in there?" By insensible degrees
The impudence dispelled the saint's esteem,
As growing snores annihilate a dream.
The frown began to blacken on his brow,
His hand to reach for "Whence?" and "Why?" and "How?"
"O, no offense, I hope," the soul explained;
"I'm rather&mdash;well, particular. I've strained
A point in coming here at all; 'tis said
That Susan Anthony (I hear she's dead
At last) and all her followers are here.
As company, they'd be&mdash;confess it&mdash;rather queer."

The saint replied, his rising anger past:
"What can I do?&mdash;the law is hard-and-fast,
Albeit unwritten and on earth unknown&mdash;
An oral order issued from the Throne.
By but one sin has Woman e'er incurred
God's wrath. To accuse Them Loud of that would be absurd."

That friar sighed, but, calling up a smile,
Said, slowly turning on his heel the while:
"Farewell, my friend. Put up the chain and bar&mdash;
I'm going, so please you, where the pretty women are."

<h2>
  THE FALL OF MISS LARKIN.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Hear me sing of Sally Larkin who, I'd have you understand,
Played accordions as well as any lady in the land;
And I've often heard it stated that her fingering was such
That Professor Schweinenhauer was enchanted with her touch;
And that beasts were so affected when her apparatus rang
That they dropped upon their haunches and deliriously sang.
This I know from testimony, though a critic, I opine,
Needs an ear that is dissimilar in some respects to mine.
She could sing, too, like a jaybird, and they say all eyes were wet
When Sally and the ranch-dog were performing a duet&mdash;
Which I take it is a song that has to be so loudly sung
As to overtax the strength of any single human lung.
That, at least, would seem to follow from the tale I have to tell,
Which (I've told you how she flourished) is how Sally Larkin fell.

One day there came to visit Sally's dad as sleek and smart
A chap as ever wandered there from any foreign part.
Though his gentle birth and breeding he did not at all obtrude
It was somehow whispered round he was a simon-pure Dude.
Howsoe'er that may have been, it was conspicuous to see
That he <i>was</i> a real Gent of an uncommon high degree.
That Sally cast her tender and affectionate regards
On this exquisite creation was, of course, upon the cards;
But he didn't seem to notice, and was variously blind
To her many charms of person and the merits of her mind,
And preferred, I grieve to say it, to play poker with her dad,
And acted in a manner that in general was bad.

One evening&mdash;'twas in summer&mdash;she was holding in her lap
Her accordion, and near her stood that melancholy chap,
Leaning up against a pillar with his lip in grog imbrued,
Thinking, maybe, of that ancient land in which he was a Dude.

Then Sally, who was melancholy too, began to hum
And elongate the accordion with a preluding thumb.
Then sighs of amorosity from Sally L. exhaled,
And her music apparatus sympathetically wailed.
"In the gloaming, O my darling!" rose that wild impassioned strain,
And her eyes were fixed on his with an intensity of pain,
Till the ranch-dog from his kennel at the postern gate came round,
And going into session strove to magnify the sound.
He lifted up his spirit till the gloaming rang and rang
With the song that to <i>his</i> darling he impetuously sang!
Then that musing youth, recalling all his soul from other scenes,
Where his fathers all were Dudes and his mothers all Dudines,
From his lips removed the beaker and politely, o'er the grog,
Said: "Miss Larkin, please be quiet: you will interrupt the dog."

Sir Impycu Lackland, from over the sea,
Has led to the altar Miss Bloatie Bondee.
The wedding took place at the Church of St. Blare;
The fashion, the rank and the wealth were all there&mdash;
No person was absent of all whom one meets.
Lord Mammon himself bowed them into their seats,
While good Sir John Satan attended the door
And Sexton Beelzebub managed the floor,
Respectfully keeping each dog to its rug,
Preserving the peace between poodle and pug.
Twelve bridesmaids escorted the bride up the aisle
To blush in her blush and to smile in her smile;
Twelve groomsmen supported the eminent groom
To scowl in his scowl and to gloom in his gloom.
The rites were performed by the hand and the lip
Of his Grace the Diocesan, Billingham Pip,
Assisted by three able-bodied divines.
He prayed and they grunted, he read, they made signs.
Such fashion, such beauty, such dressing, such grace
Were ne'er before seen in that heavenly place!
That night, full of gin, and all blazing inside,
Sir Impycu blackened the eyes of his bride.

<h2>
  A BUBBLE.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Mrs. Mehitable Marcia Moore
Was a dame of superior mind,
With a gown which, modestly fitting before,
Was greatly puffed up behind.

The bustle she wore was ingeniously planned
With an inspiration bright:
It magnified seven diameters and
Was remarkably nice and light.

It was made of rubber and edged with lace
And riveted all with brass,
And the whole immense interior space
Inflated with hydrogen gas.

The ladies all said when she hove in view
Like the round and rising moon:
"She's a stuck up thing!" which was partly true,
And men called her the Captive Balloon.

To Manhattan Beach for a bath one day
She went and she said: "O dear!
If I leave off <i>this</i> what will people say?
I shall look so uncommonly queer!"

So a costume she had accordingly made
To take it all nicely in,
And when she appeared in that suit arrayed,
She was greeted with many a grin.

Proudly and happily looking around,
She waded out into the wet,
But the water was very, very profound,
And her feet and her forehead met!

As her bubble drifted away from the shore,
On the glassy billows borne,
All cried: "Why, where is Mehitable Moore?
I saw her go in, I'll be sworn!"

Then the bulb it swelled as the sun grew hot,
Till it burst with a sullen roar,
And the sea like oil closed over the spot&mdash;
Farewell, O Mehitable Moore!

Twin banners bravely in the tumult's fore,

  REVENGE.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
A spitcat sate on a garden gate
And a snapdog fared beneath;
Careless and free was his mien, and he
Held a fiddle-string in his teeth.

She marked his march, she wrought an arch
Of her back and blew up her tail;
And her eyes were green as ever were seen,
And she uttered a woful wail.

The spitcat's plaint was as follows: "It ain't
That I am to music a foe;
For fiddle-strings bide in my own inside,
And I twang them soft and low.

"But that dog has trifled with art and rifled
A kitten of mine, ah me!
That catgut slim was marauded from him:
'Tis the string that men call E."
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Then she sounded high, in the key of Y,
A note that cracked the tombs;
And the missiles through the firmament flew
From adjacent sleeping-rooms.

As her gruesome yell from the gate-post fell
She followed it down to earth;
And that snapdog wears a placard that bears
The inscription: "Blind from birth."

Upon the Congressional door with a monstrous and mighty momentum,
Causing that vain ineffective bar to political freedom
To fly from its hinges, effacing the nasal excrescence of Dingley,
That luckless one, decently veiling the ruin with ready bandanna,
Lamented the loss of his eminence, sadly with sobs as follows:
"Ah, why was I ever elected to the halls of legislation,
So soon to be shown the door with pitiless emphasis? Truly,
I've leaned on a broken Reed, and the same has gone back on me meanly.
Where now is my prominence, erstwhile in council conspicuous, patent?
Alas, I did never before understand what I now see clearly,
To wit, that Democracy tends to level all human distinctions!"
His fate so untoward and sad the Pine-tree statesman, bewailing,
Stood in the corridor there while Democrats freed from confinement
Came trooping forth from the chamber, dissembling all, as they passed him,

Where the enterprising dealer in Caucasian hair is seen
To hold his harvest festival upon his village-green,
While the late lamented tenderfoot upon the plain is spread
With a sanguinary circle on the summit of his head;
Where the cactuses (or cacti) lift their lances in the sun,
And incautious jackass-rabbits come to sorrow as they run,
Lived a colony of settlers&mdash;old Missouri was the State
Where they formerly resided at a prehistoric date.

Now, the spot that had been chosen for this colonizing scheme
Was as waterless, believe me, as an Arizona stream.

The soil was naught but ashes, by the breezes driven free,
And an acre and a quarter were required to sprout a pea.
So agriculture languished,  for the land would not produce,
And for lack of water, whisky was the beverage in use&mdash;
Costly whisky, hauled in wagons many a weary, weary day,
Mostly needed by the drivers to sustain them on their way.
Wicked whisky! King of Evils! Why, O, why did God create
Such a curse and thrust it on us in our inoffensive state?

Once a parson came among them, and a holy man was he;
With his ailing stomach whisky wouldn't anywise agree;
So he knelt upon the <i>mesa</i> and he prayed with all his chin
That the Lord would send them water or incline their hearts to gin.

Scarcely was the prayer concluded ere an earthquake shook the land,
And with copious effusion springs burst out on every hand!
Merrily the waters gurgled, and the shock which gave them birth
Fitly was by some declared a temperance movement of the earth.
Astounded by the miracle, the people met that night
To celebrate it properly by some religious rite;
And 'tis truthfully recorded that before the moon had sunk
Every man and every woman was devotionally drunk.
A half a standard gallon (says history) per head
Of the best Kentucky prime was at that ceremony shed.
O, the glory of that country! O, the happy, happy folk.
By the might of prayer delivered from Nature's broken yoke!
Lo! the plains to the horizon all are yellowing with rye,
And the corn upon the hill-top lifts its banners to the sky!
Gone the wagons, gone the drivers, and the road is grown to grass,
Over which the incalescent Bourbon did aforetime pass.
Pikeville (that's the name they've given, in their wild, romantic way,
To that irrigation district) now distills, statistics say,
Something like a hundred gallons, out of each recurrent crop,
To the head of population&mdash;and consumes it, every drop!

<pre xml:space="preserve">
Come in, old gentleman. How do you do?
Delighted, I'm sure, that you've called.
I'm a sociable sort of a chap and you
Are a pleasant-appearing person, too,
With a head agreeably bald.
That's right&mdash;sit down in the scuttle of coal
And put up your feet in a chair.
It is better to have them there:
And I've always said that a hat of lead,
Such as I see you wear,
Was a better hat than a hat of glass.
And your boots of brass
Are a natural kind of boots, I swear.
"May you blow your nose on a paper of pins?"
    Why, certainly, man, why not?
I rather expected you'd do it before,
When I saw you poking it in at the door.
    It's dev'lish hot&mdash;
The weather, I mean. "You are twins"?
Why, that was evident at the start,
From the way that you paint your head
In stripes of purple and red,
  With dots of yellow.
  That proves you a fellow
With a love of legitimate art.
"You've bitten a snake and are feeling bad"?
  That's very sad,
But Longfellow's words I beg to recall:
Your lot is the common lot of all.
"Horses are trees and the moon is a sneeze"?
That, I fancy, is just as you please.
Some think that way and others hold
  The opposite view;
  I never quite knew,
  For the matter o' that,
When everything's been said&mdash;
  May I offer this mat
If you <i>will</i> stand on your head?
I suppose I look to be upside down
From your present point of view.
It's a giddy old world, from king to clown,
And a topsy-turvy, too.
But, worthy and now uninverted old man,
<i>You're</i> built, at least, on a normal plan
  If ever a truth I spoke.
      Smoke?
  Your air and conversation
  Are a liberal education,
And your clothes, including the metal hat
And the brazen boots&mdash;what's that?

"You never could stomach a Democrat
Since General Jackson ran?
You're another sort, but you predict
That your party'll get consummately licked?"
Good God! what a queer old man!

  BEREAVEMENT.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
A Countess (so they tell the tale)
Who dwelt of old in Arno's vale,
Where ladies, even of high degree,
Know more of love than of A.B.C,
Came once with a prodigious bribe
Unto the learned village scribe,
That most discreet and honest man
Who wrote for all the lover clan,
Nor e'er a secret had betrayed&mdash;
Save when inadequately paid.
"Write me," she sobbed&mdash;"I pray thee do&mdash;
A book about the Prince di Giu&mdash;
A book of poetry in praise
Of all his works and all his ways;
The godlike grace of his address,
His more than woman's tenderness,
His courage stern and lack of guile,
The loves that wantoned in his smile.
So great he was, so rich and kind,
I'll not within a fortnight find
His equal as a lover. O,
My God! I shall be drowned in woe!"

"What! Prince di Giu has died!" exclaimed
The honest man for letters famed,
The while he pocketed her gold;
"Of what'?&mdash;if I may be so bold."
Fresh storms of tears the lady shed:
"I stabbed him fifty times," she said.

He looked upon the ships as they
All idly lay at anchor,
Their sides with gorgeous workmen gay&mdash;
The riveter and planker&mdash;

Republicans and Democrats,
Statesmen and politicians.
He saw the swarm of prudent rats
Swimming for land positions.

He marked each "belted cruiser" fine,
Her poddy life-belts floating
In tether where the hungry brine
Impinged upon her coating.

He noted with a proud regard,
As any of his class would,
The poplar mast and poplar yard
Above the hull of bass-wood.

He saw the Eastlake frigate tall,
With quaintly carven gable,
Hip-roof and dormer-window&mdash;all
With ivy formidable.

In short, he saw our country's hope
In best of all conditions&mdash;
Equipped, to the last spar and rope,
By working politicians.

He boarded then the noblest ship
And from the harbor glided.
"Adieu, adieu!" fell from his lip.
Verdict: "He suicided."

  BIMETALISM.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Ben Bulger was a silver man,
Though not a mine had he:
He thought it were a noble plan
To make the coinage free.

"There hain't for years been sech a time,"
Said Ben to his bull pup,
"For biz&mdash;the country's broke and I'm
The hardest kind of up.

"The paper says that that's because
The silver coins is sea'ce,
And that the chaps which makes the laws
Puts gold ones in their place.

"They says them nations always be
Most prosperatin' where
The wolume of the currency
Ain't so disgustin' rare."

His dog, which hadn't breakfasted,
Dissented from his view,
And wished that he could swell, instead,
The volume of cold stew.

"Nobody'd put me up," said Ben,
"With patriot galoots
Which benefits their feller men
By playin' warious roots;

"But havin' all the tools about,
I'm goin' to commence
A-turnin' silver dollars out
Wuth eighty-seven cents.

"The feller takin' 'em can't whine:
(No more, likewise, can I):
They're better than the genooine,
Which mostly satisfy.

"It's only makin' coinage free,
And mebby might augment
The wolume of the currency
A noomerous per cent."

I don't quite see his error nor
Malevolence prepense,
But fifteen years they gave him for
That technical offense.

  FOUNDATIONS OF THE STATE
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Observe, dear Lord, what lively pranks
Are played by sentimental cranks!
First this one mounts his hinder hoofs
And brays the chimneys off the roofs;
Then that one, with exalted voice,
Expounds the thesis of his choice,
Our understandings to bombard,
Till all the window panes are starred!
A third augments the vocal shock
Till steeples to their bases rock,
Confessing, as they humbly nod,
They hear and mark the will of God.
A fourth in oral thunder vents
His awful penury of sense
Till dogs with sympathetic howls,
And lowing cows, and cackling fowls,
Hens, geese, and all domestic birds,
Attest the wisdom of his words.
Cranks thus their intellects deflate
Of theories about the State.
This one avers 'tis built on Truth,
And that on Temperance. This youth
Declares that Science bears the pile;
That graybeard, with a holy smile,
Says Faith is the supporting stone;
While women swear that Love alone
Could so unflinchingly endure
The heavy load. And some are sure
The solemn vow of Christian Wedlock
Is the indubitable bedrock.

Physicians once about the bed
Of one whose life was nearly sped
Blew up a disputatious breeze
About the cause of his disease:
This, that and t' other thing they blamed.
"Tut, tut!" the dying man exclaimed,
"What made me ill I do not care;
You've not an ounce of it, I'll swear.
And if you had the skill to make it
I'd see you hanged before I'd take it!"

Raising at once his eye-balls and the devil?

Bear me, ye whirlwinds, to some favored spot&mdash;

Fly, heedless stranger, from this spot accurst,
Where rests in Satan an offender first
In point of greatness, as in point of time,
Of new-school rascals who proclaim their crime.
Skilled with a frank loquacity to blab
The dark arcana of each mighty grab,
And famed for lying from his early youth,
He sinned secure behind a veil of truth.
Some lock their lips upon their deeds; some write
A damning record and conceal from sight;
Some, with a lust of speaking, die to quell it.
His way to keep a secret was to tell it.

The gold how lavishly applied; the great

Suffice it that a fair per cent, we're giving
Of what we robbed him of when he was living.

But in default of something to impart

Dining his way to eminence, he rowed

Like rats, obscure beneath a kitchen floor,
Gnawing and rising till obscure no more,
He ate his way to eminence, and Fame
Inscribes in gravy his immortal name.

So spurred his charger that its sides were jelly.
Grown desperate at last, it reared and threw him,
And Indigestion, overtaking, slew him.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
God's people sorely were oppressed,
I heard their lamentations long;&mdash;
I hear their singing, clear and strong,
I see their banners in the West!

The captains shout the battle-cry,
The legions muster in their might;
They turn their faces to the light,
They lift their arms, they testify:

"We sank beneath the Master's thong,
Our chafing chains were ne'er undone;&mdash;
Now clash your lances in the sun
And bless your banners with a song!

"God bides his time with patient eyes
While tyrants build upon the land;&mdash;
He lifts his face, he lifts his hand,
And from the stones his temples rise.

"Now Freedom waves her joyous wing
Beyond the foemen's shields of gold.
March forward, singing, for, behold,
The right shall rule while God is king!"

  ONE MORNING.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Because that I am weak, my love, and ill,
I cannot follow the impatient feet
Of my desire, but sit and watch the beat
Of the unpitying pendulum fulfill
The hour appointed for the air to thrill
And brighten at your coming. O my sweet,
The tale of moments is at last complete&mdash;
The tryst is broken on the gusty hill!
O lady, faithful-footed, loyal-eyed,
The long leagues silence me; yet doubt me not;
Think rather that the clock and sun have lied
And all too early, you have sought the spot.
For lo! despair has darkened all the light,
And till I see your face it still is night.

  AT THE "NATIONAL ENCAMPMENT."
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
You 're grayer than one would have thought you:
The climate you have over there
In the East has apparently brought you
Disorders affecting the hair,
Which&mdash;pardon me&mdash;seems a thought spare.

You'll not take offence at my giving
Expression to notions like these.
You might have been stronger if living
Out here in our sanative breeze.
It's unhealthy here for disease.

No, I'm not as plump as a pullet.
But that's the old wound, you see.
Remember my paunching a bullet?&mdash;
And how that it didn't agree
With&mdash;well, honest hardtack for me.

Just pass me the wine&mdash;I've a helly
And horrible kind of drouth!
When a fellow has that in his belly
Which didn't go in at his mouth
He's hotter than all Down South!

Great Scott! what a nasty day <i>that</i> was&mdash;
When every galoot in our crack
Division who didn't lie flat was
Dissuaded from further attack
By the bullet's felicitous whack.

'Twas there that our major slept under
Some cannon of ours on the crest,
Till they woke him by stilling their thunder,
And he cursed them for breaking his rest,
And died in the midst of his jest.

That night&mdash;it was late in November&mdash;
The dead seemed uncommonly chill
To the touch; and one chap I remember
Who took it exceedingly ill
When I dragged myself over his bill.

Well, comrades, I'm off now&mdash;good morning.
Your talk is as pleasant as pie,
But, pardon me, one word of warning:
Speak little of self, say I.
That's my way. God bless you. Good-bye.

Abundant bores afflict this world, and some
Are bores of magnitude that-come and&mdash;no,
They're always coming, but they never go&mdash;

Prince Fiddlefaddle, Duc de Feefawfum.
He the johndonkey is who, when I pen
Amorous verses in an idle mood

And, smirking, says he knows the lady; then
Calls me sly dog. I wish he understood

What wrecked the Roman power? One says vice,
Another indolence, another dice.
Emascle says polygamy. "Not so,"
Says Impycu&mdash;"'twas luxury and show."

Swears superstition gave the <i>coup de grÃ¢ce</i>,
Great Allison, the statesman-chap affirms
'Twas lack of coins (croaks Medico: "'T was worms")
And John P. Jones the swift suggestion collars,
Averring the no coins were silver dollars.
Thus, through the ages, each presuming quack
Turns the poor corpse upon its rotten back,
Holds a new "autopsy" and finds that death
Resulted partly from the want of breath,
But chiefly from some visitation sad
That points his argument or serves his fad.

The cause of the disaster has divined.

To a hunter from the city,
Overtaken by the night,
Spake, in tones of tender pity
For himself, an aged wight:

Of deceit and Life a sham.

And a Holy Hermit am.

"Sternly bent on Contemplation,
Far apart from human kind&mdash;&mdash;
In the hill my habitation,
In the Infinite my mind.

"Ten long years I've lived a dumb thing,
Growing bald and bent with dole.
Vainly seeking for a Something
To engage my gloomy soul.

"Gentle Pilgrim, while my roots you
Eat, and quaff my simple drink,
Please suggest whatever suits you
As a Theme for me to Think."

Then the hunter answered gravely:
"From distraction free, and strife,
You could ponder very bravely
On the Vanity of Life."

"O, thou wise and learned Teacher,
You have solved the Problem well&mdash;
You have saved a grateful creature
From the agonies of hell.

"Take another root, another
Cup of water: eat and drink.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
A merry Christmas? Prudent, as I live!&mdash;
You wish me something that you need not give.

Merry or sad, what does it signify?
To you 't is equal if I laugh, or die.

Your hollow greeting, like a parrot's jest,
Finds all its meaning in the ear addressed.

Why "merry" Christmas? Faith, I'd rather frown
Than grin and caper like a tickled clown.

When fools are merry the judicious weep;
The wise are happy only when asleep.

A present? Pray you give it to disarm
A man more powerful to do you harm.

'T was not your motive? Well, I cannot let
You pay for favors that you'll never get.

Perish the savage custom of the gift,
Founded in terror and maintained in thrift!

What men of honor need to aid their weal
They purchase, or, occasion serving, steal.

Go celebrate the day with turkeys, pies,
Sermons and psalms, and, for the children, lies.

Let Santa Claus descend again the flue;
If Baby doubt it, swear that it is true.

"A lie well stuck to is as good as truth,"
And God's too old to legislate for youth.

Hail Christmas! On my knees and fowl I fall:
For greater grace and better gravy call.

<h2>
  DIES IRAE.
</h2>
<p>
  A recent republication of the late Gen. John A. Dix's disappointing
  translation of this famous medieval hymn, together with some researches
  into its history which I happened to be making at the time, induces me to
  undertake a translation myself. It may seem presumption in me to attempt
  that which so many eminent scholars of so many generations have attempted
  before me; but the conspicuous failure of others encourages me to hope
  that success, being still unachieved, is still achievable. The fault of
  previous translations, from Lord Macaulay's to that of Gen. Dix, has been,
  I venture to think, a too strict literalness, whereby the delicate irony
  and subtle humor of the immortal poem&mdash;though doubtless these
  admirable qualities were well appreciated by the translators&mdash;have
  been utterly sacrificed in the result. In none of the English versions
  that I have examined is more than a trace of the mocking spirit of
  insincerity pervading the whole prayer,&mdash;the cool effrontery of the
  suppliant in enumerating his demerits, his serenely illogical demands of
  salvation in spite, or rather because, of them, his meek submission to the
  punishment of others, and the many similarly pleasing characteristics of
  this amusing work, being most imperfectly conveyed. By permitting myself a
  reasonable freedom of rendering&mdash;in many cases boldly supplying that
  "missing link" between the sublime and the ridiculous which the author,
  writing for the acute monkish apprehension of the 13th century, did not
  deem it necessary to insert&mdash;I have hoped at least partially to
  liberate the lurking devil of humor from his fetters, letting him caper,
  not, certainly, as he does in the Latin, but as he probably would have
  done had his creator written in English. In preserving the metre and
  double rhymes of the original, I have acted from the same reverent regard
  for the music with which, in the liturgy of the Church, the verses have
  become inseparably wedded that inspired Gen. Dix; seeking rather to
  surmount the obstacles to success by honest effort, than to avoid them by
  the adoption of an easier versification which would have deprived my
  version of all utility in religious service.
</p>
<p>
  I must bespeak the reader's charitable consideration in respect of the
  first stanza, the insuperable difficulties of which seem to have been
  purposely contrived in order to warn off trespassers at the very boundary
  of the alluring domain. I have got over the inhibition&mdash;somehow&mdash;but
  David and the Sibyl must try to forgive me if they find themselves
  represented merely by the names of those conspicuous personal qualities to
  which they probably owed, respectively, their powers of prophecy, as
  Samson's strength lay in his hair.

Dies irae! dies ilia!

Per sepulchra regionem,
Coget omnes ante thronum.

Judicanti responsura.

Liber scriptus proferetur,

Unde mundus judicetur.

Judex ergo quum sedebit,
Quicquid latet apparebit,

Quid sum miser tunc dicturus,
Quem patronem rogaturus,
Quum vix justus sit securus?

Rex tremendae majestatis,
Qui salvandos salvas gratis;
Salva me, Fons pietatis

Recordare, Jesu pie
Quod sum causa tuae viae;
Ne me perdas illa die.

Quarens me sedisti lassus
Redimisti crucem passus,
Tantus labor non sit cassus.

Juste Judex ultionis,
Donum fac remissionis
Ante diem rationis.

Ingemisco tanquam reus,
Culpa rubet vultus meus;

Qui Mariam absolvisti
Et latronem exaudisti,

Preces meae non sunt dignae,
Sed tu bonus fac benigne
Ne perenni cremer igne.

Inter oves locum praesta.
Et ab haedis me sequestra,
Statuens in parte dextra.

Confutatis maledictis,
Flammis acribus addictis,
Voca me cum benedictis.

Qua resurgent et favilla,

<h3>
  THE DAY OF WRATH.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
Day of Satan's painful duty!
Earth shall vanish, hot and sooty;
So says Virtue, so says Beauty.

Ah! what terror shall be shaping
When the Judge the truth's undraping!
Cats from every bag escaping!

Now the trumpet's invocation
Calls the dead to condemnation;
All receive an invitation.

Death and Nature now are quaking,
And the late lamented, waking,
In their breezy shrouds are shaking.

Lo! the Ledger's leaves are stirring,
And the Clerk, to them referring,
Makes it awkward for the erring.

When the Judge appears in session,
We shall all attend confession,
Loudly preaching non-suppression.

How shall I then make romances
Mitigating circumstances?
Even the just must take their chances.

King whose majesty amazes.
Save thou him who sings thy praises;
Fountain, quench my private blazes.

Pray remember, sacred Savior,
Mine the playful hand that gave your
Death-blow. Pardon such behavior.

Seeking me fatigue assailed thee,
Calvary's outlook naught availed thee:
Now 't were cruel if I failed thee.

Righteous judge and learned brother,
Pray thy prejudices smother
Ere we meet to try each other.

Sighs of guilt my conscience gushes,
And my face vermilion flushes;
Spare me for my pretty blushes.

Thief and harlot, when repenting,
Thou forgav'st&mdash;be complimenting
Me with sign of like relenting.

If too bold is my petition
I'll receive with due submission
My dismissal&mdash;from perdition.

When thy sheep thou hast selected
From the goats, may I, respected,
Stand amongst them undetected.

When offenders are indicted,
And with trial-flames ignited,
Elsewhere I'll attend if cited.

Ashen-hearted, prone, and prayerful,
When of death I see the air full,
Lest I perish, too, be careful.

On that day of lamentation,
When, to enjoy the conflagration.
Men come forth, O, be not cruel.
Spare me, Lord&mdash;make them thy fuel.

  THE MAN BORN BLIND.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
A man born blind received his sight
By a painful operation;
And these are things he saw in the light
Of an infant observation.

He saw a merchant, good and wise.
And greatly, too, respected,
Who looked, to those imperfect eyes,
Like a swindler undetected.

He saw a patriot address
A noisy public meeting.
And said: "Why, that's a calf. I guess.
That for the teat is bleating."

A doctor stood beside a bed
And shook his summit sadly.
"O see that foul assassin!" said
The man who saw so badly.

He saw a lawyer pleading for
A thief whom they'd been jailing,
And said: "That's an accomplice, or
My sight again is failing."

Upon the Bench a Justice sat,
With nothing to restrain him;
"'Tis strange," said the observer, "that
They ventured to unchain him."

With theologic works supplied,
He saw a solemn preacher;
"A burglar with his kit," he cried,
"To rob a fellow creature."

A bluff old farmer next he saw
Sell produce in a village,
And said: "What, what! is there no law
To punish men for pillage?"

A dame, tall, fair and stately, passed,
Who many charms united;
He thanked his stars his lot was cast
Where sepulchers were whited.

He saw a soldier stiff and stern,
"Full of strange oaths" and toddy;
But was unable to discern
A wound upon his body.

Ten square leagues of rolling ground
To one great man belonging,
Looked like one little grassy mound
With worms beneath it thronging.

A palace's well-carven stones,
Where Dives dwelt contented,
Seemed built throughout of human bones
With human blood cemented.

He watched the yellow shining thread
A silk-worm was a-spinning;
"That creature's coining gold." he said,
"To pay some girl for sinning."

His eyes were so untrained and dim
All politics, religions,
Arts, sciences, appeared to him
But modes of plucking pigeons.

And so he drew his final breath,
And thought he saw with sorrow
Some persons weeping for his death
Who'd be all smiles to-morrow.

<h2>
  A NIGHTMARE.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
I dreamed that I was dead. The years went by:
The world forgot that such a man as I
Had ever lived and written: other names
Were hailed with homage, in their turn to die.

Out of my grave a giant beech upgrew.
Its roots transpierced my body, through and through,
My substance fed its growth. From many lands
Men came in troops that giant tree to view.

'T was sacred to my memory and fame&mdash;
My monument. But Allen Forman came,
Filled with the fervor of a new untruth,
And carved upon the trunk his odious name!

Horas non numero nisi serenas.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
The rain is fierce, it flogs the earth,
And man's in danger.
O that my mother at my birth
Had borne a stranger!
The flooded ground is all around.
The depth uncommon.
How blest I'd be if only she
Had borne a salmon.

If still denied the solar glow
'T were bliss ecstatic
To be amphibious&mdash;but O,
To be aquatic!
We're worms, men say, o' the dust, and they
That faith are firm of.
O, then, be just: show me some dust
To be a worm of.

The pines are chanting overhead
A psalm uncheering.
It's O, to have been for ages dead
  And hard of hearing!
Restore, ye Pow'rs, the last bright hours
  The dial reckoned;
'Twas in the time of Egypt's prime&mdash;
  Rameses II.

<h2>
  THE CONFEDERATE FLAGS.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Tut-tut! give back the flags&mdash;how can you care
You veterans and heroes?
Why should you at a kind intention swear
Like twenty Neroes?

Suppose the act was not so overwise&mdash;
Suppose it was illegal&mdash;
Is 't well on such a question to arise
And pinch the Eagle?

Nay, let's economize his breath to scold
And terrify the alien
Who tackles him, as Hercules of old
The bird Stymphalian.

Among the rebels when we made a breach
Was it to get their banners?
That was but incidental&mdash;'t was to teach
Them better manners.

They know the lesson well enough to-day;
Now, let us try to show them
That we 're not only stronger far than they.
(How we did mow them!)

But more magnanimous. You see, my lads,
  'T was an uncommon riot;
The warlike tribes of Europe fight for "fads,"
  We fought for quiet.

If we were victors, then we all must live
  With the same flag above us;
'Twas all in vain unless we now forgive
  And make them love us.

Let kings keep trophies to display above
  Their doors like any savage;
The freeman's trophy is the foeman's love,
  Despite war's ravage.

"Make treason odious?" My friends, you'll find
  You can't, in right and reason,
While "Washington" and "treason" are combined&mdash;
  "Hugo" and "treason."

All human governments must take the chance
  And hazard of sedition.
O, wretch! to pledge your manhood in advance
  To blind submission.

It may be wrong, it may be right, to rise
  In warlike insurrection:
The loyalty that fools so dearly prize
  May mean subjection.

Be loyal to your country, yes&mdash;but how
If tyrants hold dominion?
The South believed they did; can't you allow
For that opinion?

He who will never rise though rulers plods
His liberties despising
How is he manlier than the <i>sans culottes</i>
Who's always rising?

Give back the foolish flags whose bearers fell
Too valiant to forsake them.
Is it presumptuous, this counsel? Well,
I helped to take them.

  HAEC FABULA DOCET.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
A rat who'd gorged a box of bane
And suffered an internal pain,
Came from his hole to die (the label
Required it if the rat were able)
And found outside his habitat
A limpid stream. Of bane and rat
'T was all unconscious; in the sun
It ran and prattled just for fun.
Keen to allay his inward throes,
The beast immersed his filthy nose
And drank&mdash;then, bloated by the stream,
And filled with superheated steam,
Exploded with a rascal smell,
Remarking, as his fragments fell
Astonished in the brook: "I'm thinking
This water's damned unwholesome drinking!"

<h2>
  AZRAEL.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
The moon in the field of the keel-plowed main
Was watching the growing tide:
A luminous peasant was driving his wain,
And he offered my soul a ride.

But I nourished a sorrow uncommonly tall,
And I fixed him fast with mine eye.
"O, peasant," I sang with a dying fall,
"Go leave me to sing and die."

The water was weltering round my feet,
As prone on the beach they lay.
I chanted my death-song loud and sweet;
"Kioodle, ioodle, iay!"

Then I heard the swish of erecting ears
Which caught that enchanted strain.
The ocean was swollen with storms of tears
That fell from the shining swain.

"O, poet," leapt he to the soaken sand,
"That ravishing song would make
The devil a saint." He held out his hand
And solemnly added: "Shake."

We shook. "I crave a victim, you see,"
He said&mdash;"you came hither to die."
The Angel of Death, 't was he! 't was he!
And the victim he crove was I!

'T was I, Fred Emerson Brooks, the bard;
And he knocked me on the head.
O Lord! I thought it exceedingly hard,
For I didn't want to be dead.

"You'll sing no worser for that," said he,
And he drove with my soul away,
O, death-song singers, be warned by me,
Kioodle, ioodle, iay!

<h2>
  AGAIN.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Well, I've met her again&mdash;at the Mission.
She'd told me to see her no more;
It was not a command&mdash;a petition;
I'd granted it once before.

Yes, granted it, hoping she'd write me.
Repenting her virtuous freak&mdash;
Subdued myself daily and nightly
For the better part of a week.

And then ('twas my duty to spare her
The shame of recalling me) I
Just sought her again to prepare her
For an everlasting good-bye.

O, that evening of bliss&mdash;shall I ever
Forget it?&mdash;with Shakespeare and Poe!
She said, when 'twas ended: "You're never
To see me again. And now go."

As we parted with kisses 'twas human
And natural for me to smile
As I thought, "She's in love, and a woman:
She'll send for me after a while."

But she didn't; and so&mdash;well, the Mission
Is fine, picturesque and gray;
It's an excellent place for contrition&mdash;
And sometimes she passes that way.

That's how it occurred that I met her,
And that's ah there is to tell&mdash;
Except that I'd like to forget her
Calm way of remarking: "I'm well."

It was hardly worth while, all this keying
My soul to such tensions and stirs
To learn that her food was agreeing
With that little stomach of hers.

  HOMO PODUNKENSIS.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
As the poor ass that from his paddock strays
Might sound abroad his field-companions' praise,
Recounting volubly their well-bred leer,
Their port impressive and their wealth of ear,
Mistaking for the world's assent the clang
Of echoes mocking his accurst harangue;
So the dull clown, untraveled though at large,
Visits the city on the ocean's marge,
Expands his eyes and marvels to remark
Each coastwise schooner and each alien bark;
Prates of "all nations," wonders as he stares
That native merchants sell imported wares,
Nor comprehends how in his very view
A foreign vessel has a foreign crew;
Yet, faithful to the hamlet of his birth,
Swears it superior to aught on earth,
Sighs for the temples locally renowned&mdash;
The village school-house and the village pound&mdash;
And chalks upon the palaces of Rome
The peasant sentiments of "Home, Sweet Home!"

<h2>
  A SOCIAL CALL.
</h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Well, well, old Father Christmas, is it you,
With your thick neck and thin pretense of virtue?
Less redness in the nose&mdash;nay, even some blue
Would not, I think, particularly hurt you.
When seen close to, not mounted in your car,
You look the drunkard and the pig you are.

No matter, sit you down, for I am not
In a gray study, as you sometimes find me.
Merry? O, no, nor wish to be, God wot,
But there's another year of pain behind me.
That's something to be thankful for: the more
There are behind, the fewer are before.

I know you, Father Christmas, for a scamp,
But Heaven endowed me at my soul's creation
With an affinity to every tramp
That walks the world and steals its admiration.
For admiration is like linen left
Upon the line&mdash;got easiest by theft.

Good God! old man, just think of it! I've stood,
With brains and honesty, some five-and-twenty
Long years as champion of all that's good,
And taken on the mazzard thwacks a-plenty.
Yet now whose praises do the people bawl?
Those of the fellows whom I live to maul!

Why, this is odd!&mdash;the more I try to talk
Of you the more my tongue grows egotistic
To prattle of myself! I'll try to balk
Its waywardness and be more altruistic.
So let us speak of others&mdash;how they sin,
And what a devil of a state they 're in!

That's all I have to say. Good-bye, old man.
Next year you possibly may find me scolding&mdash;
Or miss me altogether: Nature's plan
Includes, as I suppose, a final folding
Of these poor empty hands. Then drop a tear
To think they'll never box another ear.
