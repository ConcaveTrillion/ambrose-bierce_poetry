<h2>
	PREFACE.
  </h2>
  <p>
	Some small part of this book being personally censorious, and in that part
	the names of real persons being used without their assent, it seems fit
	that a few words be said of the matter in sober prose. What it seems well
	to say I have already said with sufficient clarity in the preface of
	another book, somewhat allied to this by that feature of its character. I
	quote from "Black Beetles in Amber:"
  </p>
  <p>
	"Many of the verses in this book are republished, with considerable
	alterations, from various newspapers. Of my motives in writing and in now
	republishing I do not care to make either defence or explanation, except
	with reference to those who since my first censure of them have passed
	away. To one having only a reader's interest in the matter it may easily
	seem that the verses relating to those might properly have been omitted
	from this collection. But if these pieces, or indeed, if any considerable
	part of my work in literature, have the intrinsic worth which by this
	attempt to preserve some of it I have assumed, their permanent suppression
	is impossible, and it is only a question of when and by whom they will be
	republished. Some one will surely search them out and put them in
	circulation.
  </p>
  <p>
	"I conceive it the right of an author to have his fugitive work collected
	in his lifetime; and this seems to me especially true of one whose work,
	necessarily engendering animosities, is peculiarly exposed to challenge as
	unjust. That is a charge that can best be examined before time has effaced
	the evidence. For the death of a man of whom I have written what I may
	venture to think worthy to live I am no way responsible; and however
	sincerely I may regret it, I can hardly consent that it shall affect my
	literary fortunes. If the satirist who does not accept the remarkable
	doctrine that, while condemning the sin he should spare the sinner, were
	bound to let the life of his work be coterminous with that of his subject
	his were a lot of peculiar hardship.
  </p>
  <p>
	"Persuaded of the validity of all this I have not hesitated to reprint
	even certain 'epitaphs' which, once of the living, are now of the dead, as
	all the others must eventually be. The objection inheres in all forms of
	applied satire&mdash;my understanding of whose laws and liberties is at
	least derived from reverent study of the masters. That in respect of
	matters herein mentioned I have but followed their practice can be shown
	by abundant instance and example."
  </p>
  <p>
	In arranging these verses for publication I have thought it needless to
	classify them according to character, as "Serious," "Comic,"
	"Sentimental," "Satirical," and so forth. I do the reader the honor to
	think that he will readily discern the nature of what he is reading; and I
	entertain the hope that his mood will accommodate itself without
	disappointment to that of his author.
